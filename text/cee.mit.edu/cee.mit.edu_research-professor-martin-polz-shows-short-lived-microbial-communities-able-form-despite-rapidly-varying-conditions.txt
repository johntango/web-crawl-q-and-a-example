The researchers, including graduate student Brian Cleary of the Broad Institute and the computational and systems biology program; former CEE postdoc Antonio Martin-Platero; CEE postdoctoral associate Kathryn Kauffman; and former CEE graduate student and biological engineering postdoc Sarah Preheim, used a time series method and an algorithm to understand the patterns and behavior of the communities over time. The paper was published in Nature Communications. Read more on MIT News.
