We also expect that the individual experiences of applicants will richly inform applications and, as such, they will be considered with the entirety of a student’s record.Additionally, CEE will not be accepting GRE test scores for applicants during the 2021-2022 admission graduate admissions cycle.Ultimately, even in these challenging times, our goal remains to form graduate student cohorts that are collectively excellent and composed of outstanding individuals who will challenge and support one another.Questions or concerns about this statement should be directed to the Academic Programs Office at cee-apo@mit.eduSubscribe to our newsletter  Email* EmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
