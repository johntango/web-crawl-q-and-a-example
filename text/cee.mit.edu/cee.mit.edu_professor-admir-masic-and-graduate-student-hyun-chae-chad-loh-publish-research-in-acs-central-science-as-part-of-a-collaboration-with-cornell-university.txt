Edgerton Career Development Assistant Professor Admir Masic and graduate student Hyun-Chae Chad Loh, published research in ACS Central Science titled “Mapping and Profiling Lipid Distribution in a 3D Model of Breast Cancer Progression,” as part of a long-standing collaboration with Cornell University. The researchers utilized Raman spectroscopic imaging, a technique that provides information about the nature and spatial distribution of lipids, to study breast cancer cells in multicellular 3D spheroids. The researchers were able to gain insight into the relationships among lipid profiles, both spatial and compositional, and cell microenvironment and malignancy potential. Read more here.
