Khouri ’15 won for her work devising a computational tool that can be used to design ciliated microchannels with enhanced mixing performance in microfluidic devices. Pagonakis ’15 won with his research which produced a new algorithmic script and framework to help engineers and architects find the least volume structure solution for any load bearing arch design regardless of construction material quality. The work could lead to the use of cheaper, more available materials like lower-grade concrete in the design of stronger, more sustainable arched structures due to optimized geometric compression.
