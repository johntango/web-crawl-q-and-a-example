The university offers courses in engineering, architecture, and industrial design.In the morning, we listened to two lectures from faculty members of the university. The first was entitled ‘Torino. Urban history of a Cultural City’ and was given by Mauro Volpiano. The presentation touched upon the history of the 2,000 year old city we are currently residing in.Turin had many different identities throughout history. Twice in its existence it was a capital city: once for the dukedom of Savoy in 1563 and then a second time for Italy after the country’s unification in 1861. After the capital of Italy was moved in 1863, Turin was forced to reinvent itself as an industrial city and it became the primary manufacturer of Fiats.Our second lecture was given by Chiara Devotion and touched upon the residences of the royal house of Savoy. She discussed the Corona di Delizie, which is a crown shaped geographical region of palaces, gardens, and hunting grounds connected with the royal House of Savoy. This includes Venaria Reale, which we visited yesterday.After a thorough tour of the rooms of the Valentine Palace and a lunch break, we moved on to the Church of San Lorenzo and the Palace Madama. Both were filled with beautiful baroque architecture.The dome in The Church of San LorenzoA restorer working on removing fake gold paint in the Church of San Lorenzo. The fake gold paint was a result of an uninformed, poor restoration years ago.Admir appreciating Palace Madama  PreviousONE-MA3 2018: Pompeii for the Day   NextONE-MA3 2018: A Day Off in Rome  FieldworkIn The News   March 29, 2023 | Fieldwork | fuelmedia Embracing Preservation of Hawaiian Knowledge on the Big Island    August 27, 2020 | CEE Profiles | zgoodale CEE undergrad shares internship experience with World Bank    August 27, 2019 | CEE | ceemit MISTI Bikepacks the Atacama    August 27, 2019 | Fieldwork | ceemit ONE-MA3: Atlantis and Gotham in One Roman City    November 19, 2018 | ONE-MA3 2018 | ceemit ONE-MA3 Project: Plastics + Concrete    November 14, 2018 | ONE-MA3 2018 | ceemit ONE-MA3 Project: Materials of the Pyramids Subscribe to our newsletter  Email* CommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
