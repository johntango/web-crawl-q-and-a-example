Recently, a team including Dr. Zhao Qin, Professor Markus Buehler and Course 1 sophomore Mary Hwang have revealed for the first time that only two percent of the surface area of graphene is affected by wrinkles. To confirm this result, Zhao and Hwang have conducted an atom-by-atom analysis of the mechanics of graphene wrinkling, and developed a continuum mechanics model for different graphene geometries, sizes and loading conditions. This study provides important insights into the deformation of graphene, as well as efficient tools for designing the next generation of graphene nano-electronics.
