Stephanie Moore, a Sloan School graduate student and one of the organizers, said, “The WIP is a solutions-to-market competition for water startups that are related to all types of water issues including treatment, contamination, conservation, processes, technologies, research and development.” Teams will submit their entries for the prize in late December and compete for seed funding in the spring.
