By dissipating wave energy, the plants could help protect vulnerable shorelines in the face of rising sea levels. Through experiments and mathematical modeling, the researchers were able to quantify how large and dense seagrass meadows must be in order to provide sufficient damping of waves in a given geographic, climate, and oceanographic setting. The abundant seagrass could help prevent beach erosion, protect seawalls, improve water quality, and absorb carbon. Read more on MIT News.     PreviousProfessor Eric J.
