Learn how to crawl your website and build a Q/A bot with the OpenAI API. You can find the full tutorial in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings).

This runs best in CodeSpaces
crawlURL crawls a given URL and cdownloads MAX_PAGES number of pages
and stores them in text directory
web-qa.py does same but also constructs chunks and embeddings
it aswers questions from the user using cosine similarity
