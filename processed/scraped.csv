He noted Mayor Bill de Blasio’s announcement just last month of “One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City,” a comprehensive plan for a sustainable and resilient city that addresses the profound social, economic, and environmental challenges ahead.“OneNYC is ambitious and sets clear and aggressive goals,” Zarrilli said, citing the announcement. “Its initiatives will prepare New York City for the future — how we live, work, learn, and play, raise our children, and enjoy all our city has to offer. Achieving these goals requires nothing less than bold, innovative solutions.”Zarrilli and Buehler met earlier this spring to discuss ways faculty and student research might play a part to deliver these bold, innovative solutions. One example is CLAIRITY, the noteworthy work of CEE’s Class of 2014 capstone project that measures air quality using low-cost sensor networks at a fraction of the cost of typical air quality systems.Associate Professor Jesse Kroll, who leads atmospheric chemistry studies, described CLAIRITY at the alumni event in greater detail. He explained that it’s ideal for densely-packed urban neighborhoods because measurements are much more spatially-resolved and can be acquired more cost-effectively in multiple, small-scale environments. Further, it empowers residents to gather and read air quality measurements for their locale and then tie the results back into community education, outreach, and action. CLAIRITY was implemented at MIT last year and gave measurements that generally agreed with those taken by more expensive monitors located in Boston.CLAIRITY measures nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter using 20 small, inexpensive sensors networked via wireless technology. Kroll stressed the importance of knowing the source and fate of key air pollutants, because even so-called “clean” air can still have high enough pollutant levels to pose major risks to public health.“MIT’s civil and environmental program is unique because we seek large-scale impacts on people and sustainability to improve lives,” Buehler said in his event remarks. “We call this approach ‘big engineering.’ We envision what an ideal city should be, then imagine the possible solutions by inventing and building the desired products, tools, and systems to make it reality.”Buehler explained how finding solutions requires people to work beyond traditional professional boundaries. Whether working to preserve the environment, lower energy costs, facilitate urban movement, or construct structures that work better and last longer, engineers need to build bridges across disciplines — not just build bridges.For example, Assistant Professor Saurabh Amin’s presentation focused on building more resilient electricity-distribution systems. He talked about ways in which ‘smart’ networked infrastructures can help increase situation awareness and control, plus respond faster if threatened or hacked. Two specific examples covered by Amin were the use of smart meter data for detection of energy diversion by fraudulent customers, and automated control of distributed energy resources in response to contingencies, such as a sudden supply-demand mismatch or a malicious disruption of network components. “I was staggered by the breadth of work being done in the civil and environmental engineering department,” said Seth Hulkower SM ’86, president of Strategic Energy Advisory Services. “As a New York City resident and longtime electric utility professional, I spend a lot of time thinking about resilient infrastructure. Regulatory models are changing and the industry is scrambling to adapt. The only way we’ll be able to do this cost-effectively is with new technology and analytical techniques. I saw implications for operation of electric grids in every presentation.”Malinda Foy ’87, director of planning and analysis for Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bridges and Tunnels, said she came to hear more about CEE’s innovations in urban transportation research and implementation.“In my job, I need to know not only what’s happening today in transportation, but also what’s at the frontier of new initiatives,” Foy said. “I’m interested in continuing discussions with MIT CEE, so I can proactively bring the best solutions to New York City.”Assistant Professor Carolina Osorio and Associate Professor Marta González presented examples of their work in this burgeoning transportation study area. Osorio’s presentation showed results from her work in a Manhattan road network containing the Queensborough Bridge area. She emphasized the importance of managing areterials as part of larger-scale networks, regardless of geographic governance. It doesn’t make sense to manage traffic inputs on one side of a tunnel, she said, if the resulting improvements exacerbate traffic on the other end in a different borough.González, a self-professed big data geek, conducts research at the intersection of human dynamics, urban mobility, and transportation design. She built a computational model and algorithm to learn about peoples’ travel activity patterns to better help cities anticipate and remediate congestion. Her work analyze traces from communication data to infer where people usually begin and end their daily routines. She creates models informed by this anonymized data and evaluates the benefits of traffic management solutions via smart routing applications.  Lydia Bourouiba, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Assistant Professor in CEE, took the audience on a different path describing her work in disease transmission. Her work is especially important to dense urban environments such as New York City, which boasts the greatest use of public transportation in the nation. Defying a traditional view that a sneeze can lead to greatest virus transmission through its large droplets, she champions new research that shows that the effect of the sneeze cloud can carry the small droplets much further away than what was initially thought. The smaller the droplet, she says, the easier and further it’s transmitted and the longer it stays in the air. Last month, Bourouiba received an Alumni Class Funds grant in support of a curriculum development project that allows undergrads to gather their own dataset to enhance understanding of fluid dynamics and its role in various mixing and droplet formation phenomena.The evening event preceded by just a few hours Mayor de Blasio’s announcement of his new fiscal budget and 10-year capital plan for the city.“By funding an agenda to make the city stronger, safer, and more competitive, … the budget provides a strategic vision to guide New York City through uncertain times and prepare for the future,” said a statement from the mayor’s office.The 2015 / 2016 budget outlines increased government support for the mayor’s green buildings plan, allowing the city to retrofit all public buildings with any significant energy use by 2025. The new budget also increases funding to improve transportation infrastructure, including roads, tunnels, and bridges. This investment is part of the mayor’s broader plan to achieve an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050, making it the largest city in the world to make that commitment.MIT faculty and students want to help cities like New York meet its aggressive goals to improve lives through the innovative use of the type of work conducted in MIT CEE. They accomplish this by working together, and reaching out to others with complementary skills and talents, to succeed.  PreviousSustainability of the Built Environment NextTranslating thought to print 2015 News ReleasesIn The News December 23, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Pushing engineering boundaries to spur infrastructure innovation December 21, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT’s Buehler and Reis elected to Society of Engineering Science Board of Directors December 18, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Sharing best practices for getting published in science December 14, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT Transit Leaders Roundtable opens a discussion on transportation challenges December 14, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT community and others recently joined together for a weekend to solve current industry energy challenges December 7, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Stretchable hydrogel electronics Subscribe to our newsletter Email* EmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

By dissipating wave energy, the plants could help protect vulnerable shorelines in the face of rising sea levels. Through experiments and mathematical modeling, the researchers were able to quantify how large and dense seagrass meadows must be in order to provide sufficient damping of waves in a given geographic, climate, and oceanographic setting. The abundant seagrass could help prevent beach erosion, protect seawalls, improve water quality, and absorb carbon. Read more on MIT News.    PreviousProfessor Eric J.

Some groups had put their black, rust-colored, or grey powders into the kiln the previous evening. Now, after a night of firing, most of the pigments came out as a combination of blues, turquoises, and teal colors…a success! As for my group, our powder went into the kiln as a bright turquoise color, which gave us a false sense of confidence as we waited overnight. When our crucible came out of the furnace, what used to be that bright-turquoise color had melted down into a glob of some strange greyish silver material…definitely not Egyptian blue. After a test of Visible Induced Luminescence (VIL) in a dark room void of sunlight, we discovered for sure that the blue pigments emitted varying amounts of fluorescence, while my group’s pigment gave off barely any fluorescence. Afterward, we contemplated our synthesis procedure and hypothesized that perhaps we had included too much flux (sodium carbonate) or simply hadn’t added enough copper, which could make the final product bluer. Either way, if we go back to try our synthesis again back at MIT, we will know what to adjust in our experiment!Our Egyptian blue pigments after one night of firing in the furnace            Midday, we explored other materials of cultural heritage from around the world through a few lectures taught by guest professors and graduate students. For instance, we learned about a sustainable, ancient type of Amazonian soil from MIT Professor Dorothy Hosler. Ideally, agriculture within areas of the Amazon rainforest shouldn’t thrive very well. But, interestingly, this specific type of soil which is known as “terra preta de índio” (Indian black earth) is carbon-rich and gives rise to a sustainable and efficient manner to raise crops. Still, researchers are not certain how or why this soil contains carbon in this way, which provides us with the opportunity to pursue this as a research project in the near future at MIT! We were also enlightened a little bit by the least-massive mass in the world: aerogels, which are now being used in the restoration of paintings and old buildings (fun fact: there is a display of a mass of aerogel at the MIT museum!). Entering into an area of cultural heritage combined with some fantasy, we got to explore another area of material science that we had not yet been exposed to: metals! At least, we were trained to handle the actual products of medieval metalsmithing in short sword-fighting drill sessions. We quickly caught on that medieval swords are not simply a scientific feat of ancient artistry when it comes to metals, but also that medieval sword fighting is an art-form itself!Practicing our medieval sword fighting skills!            Finally, we stepped back even further in time to exercise our skills in reading Egyptian hieroglyphics. The master who had taught us sword fighting guided us in this lesson, too.  Growing up, I always assumed that hieroglyphics represented exactly what each picture depicted. For me, my interpretation would have gone something like this: a bird standing next to three trees and a bowl then flies over a river and then runs into a snake. After this professional lesson, though, I realized that I was obviously mistaken. Actually, different combinations and repetitions of figures depict different sounds, words, or ideas. What I found most interesting about Egyptian hieroglyphics was that there are no vowels in the written language. The consonant sounds are there, but the vowels must be filled in, which gives many Egyptian words and names like “Tutankhamun” or “Hatshepsut” that particular and easily identifiable Egyptian sound. Afterward, we participated in a hands-on exploration of how the Egyptians created their hieroglyphs, starting with a layer of mud and hemp that they would have applied to the surface of sarcophagi. For us, we used small wooden frames already filled with a mixture of mud and hemp. Then, like the Egyptians, we smoothed a layer of gypsum (basically plaster) over the mud and after letting it dry, used feathers and other brushes to paint natural pigments over the surface in patterns of hieroglyphics and iconic images of Egyptian gods. Overall, it was a day full of scientific experimentation and exploration, walking through a live version of a history book, and getting to recreate activities that humans did thousands of years ago around the world in different ancient civilizations.Learning how to create hieroglyphics the Egyptian way with natural pigments on top of gypsum PreviousONE-MA3 – Day XXI: Art Restoration and Artificial Pigments in Aramengo NextONE-MA3: Atlantis and Gotham in One Roman City ONE-MA3 2019In The News August 27, 2019 | Fieldwork | ceemit ONE-MA3: Atlantis and Gotham in One Roman City July 31, 2019 | ONE-MA3 2019 | ceemit ONE-MA3 – Day XXII: Walking Through Amazonian, Medieval, and Egyptian Histories and Culture July 31, 2019 | ONE-MA3 2019 | ceemit ONE-MA3 – Day XXI: Art Restoration and Artificial Pigments in Aramengo July 19, 2019 | 2019 News in Brief | ceemit ONE-MA3: Castle on the Hill July 17, 2019 | ONE-MA3 2019 | ceemit ONE-MA3 – Day XX: Photogrammetry among Pharaohs!

But, it has been an exciting change! With a completely new environment came a new set of archeological topics to begin learning about. After an attempt to catch a bus in vain, we ended up taking taxis to La Venaria Reale at the edge of Turin overlooking the Alps, which is both a palace once owned by the Savoia family and now also serves as home to one of the three art restoration schools in Italy. Interestingly enough, the entire palace was restored only ten years ago, yet on the inner sides of the Baroque facade walls are fantastic examples of modern architecture that seem to float inside of the large barrel-vaulted rooms and house the school’s actual art restoration labs, which we were lucky enough to tour later in the day! The Galleria Grande in La Venaria Reale Immediately after arrival to the palace, we first learned all about gypsum, a rock that is baked (to dehydrate it), turned into powder, mixed with water again, and then sculpted to form stucco on walls and ceilings. Even though the word “gypsum” seemed so foreign to most of us, we were surprised to find out that it is basically what we know as plaster of Paris. We learned all about gypsum and plaster and then got to tour the palace rooms and corridors that were completely covered in gorgeous displays of stucco. As semi-material-science students, we also got to witness the integral instability of gypsum in some of the ceiling sculptures that had clearly degraded and did not show much promise of surviving in a pristine position. Gypsum is another material that art restorers are challenged by when it comes to preservation to save this artwork from the Baroque period.Examining pictures of cross-sections of paintings taken from a scanner In addition to touring the palace gardens, my favorite part of the palace visit was going inside of the art restoration labs. We were given a run-down about how research of the stratigraphy (the layers) of a painting is completed. We now know that it involves taking a sample from a painting, surrounding it with resin, taking photos with visible light and X-ray, and using all of this data to determine what the original sketch was, and what the original methods of painting were. Pictures taken using a microscope are not only used for the purpose of restoring paintings, but also to examine textiles on the microscale. When the images were polarized, an entire color scale was revealed in the seemingly-simple material, which was absolutely fascinating! Afterward, we saw the machines that can make X-ray scans of an object from nearly every angle in order to discover the structure inside of an artifact without actually breaking into it. This is a commonly used technique that allows for the protection of cultural heritage, while also being able to learn as much from it as possible. Overall, today we had the amazing opportunity to see first-hand everything that we had been learning about in lectures!Polarized picture of a textile under a microscope PreviousONE-MA3 – Searching for Egyptian Blue and Creating Our Own NextONE-MA3 – Day XVIII: Night at the Egyptian Museum…During the Day ONE-MA3 2019In The News August 27, 2019 | Fieldwork | ceemit ONE-MA3: Atlantis and Gotham in One Roman City July 31, 2019 | ONE-MA3 2019 | ceemit ONE-MA3 – Day XXII: Walking Through Amazonian, Medieval, and Egyptian Histories and Culture July 31, 2019 | ONE-MA3 2019 | ceemit ONE-MA3 – Day XXI: Art Restoration and Artificial Pigments in Aramengo July 19, 2019 | 2019 News in Brief | ceemit ONE-MA3: Castle on the Hill July 17, 2019 | ONE-MA3 2019 | ceemit ONE-MA3 – Day XX: Photogrammetry among Pharaohs!

At Taste, a mid to high tier market that is a few minute walk away from the HK Innovation Node, we were blown away by the amount of packaging that we saw. While there were your typical suspects of snacks, spices and seasonings, and grains, we also saw individually packaged fruits and pre-processed whole fish!       Plastic individual packing on fruits and pre-processed fishWe also unexpectedly stumbled across a section in the store where they were selling oils and vinegars in refillable glass containers that they had just recently started offering. In a quick interview with the worker stationed there, we found out that this type of service was fairly popular and offers slight discounts to people who bring back the bottles, but requires a bit of work on the workers’ side to service the customers.These findings encouraged us that the problem we aim to tackle is a real one that would require a good amount of engineering to figure out a solution for all the different types of things that are packaged at a supermarket.1.08: Primary Market ResearchToday we continued our primary market research but with a more conscious goal of interviewing both workers and shoppers. We also chose to visit three different types of supermarkets: a zero-waste market, City Super, and Welcome to cover specialty stores, high end markets, and common markets respectively. At the end of the day, we had interviewed about 15 people covering the spectrum of experiences with packaging that we hoped for. The insights we received on the types of problems that exist with the current packaging situation, the complications to adopting a new system, and the difficulties faced by current zero-waste markets that will definitely be extremely useful in guiding our approach.  Food containers at the Live Zero, a zero-waste market1.11: Requirement Prioritizing, Brainstorm Session, Market SegmentationAfter the past two days, while we saw that no one was immediately saying that packaging waste was something that they wanted a solution for, their answers to tangential questions gave us confidence that it is something people do indeed want. With that in mind, we set today to using some of the exercises that they taught us in the Disciplined Entrepreneurship workshops to figure out what our customer base was and what things we would want our solution to address.Ideating our project requirementsAt the end of the day, we have a mentor session where we quickly explained the problem area that we wanted to address and the information we had gathered so far on it. In short, our mentors wanted us to narrow down the scope of who we were targeting as customers and nail down that the problem was one they explicitly said they would want a solution for.1.12: Pivot?We ended last night earlier to digest what we had heard during the mentor session so that we didn’t make any big decisions after what was already a long day. Going into today, we decided to each come individually with how we would want to move forward with the venture. After a team debrief, we decided to pivot. To facilitate this, we had a brainstorming session where we discussed a variety of ideas and utilized a Pugh Chart to help us objectively rate them and narrow down the possibilities. At the end of this exercise, we were down to four ideas, three of which we immediately started interviewing the rest of the MEMSI participants to get a sense of how common these problems we identified were.Pugh chart of alternative ideas By the end of the day, we decided to redefine the scope of our problem statement to focus more upon a demonstrated customer desire for more custom packaging of a variety of dried goods that we felt would be a common need across a few groups such as students and people living alone or with a partner. We ended today with a few tasks to tackle for the next day.List of to-do’s for the next day1.14: Task Forces: Engineering and Design, Market AnalysisWith a new problem area that we felt confident as a whole team to move forward with, we decided to start splitting up the group to focus on the various aspects of the project. At this early stage, we just broadly defined two large areas that we felt split the team up well: engineering and design tackled by Mike, Maggie, and myself, while market anaysis was tackled by Tim, Ilona, and Janice.1.15: PivotWe started off the day with a team check-in to make sure that we continue to share the same vision of our solution, in particular to talk through aspects such as our value proposition and market entry strategy.In the afternoon, we have another check-in with the instructors Eliane and Marina who shared with us their concerns about the problem we identified being one that people would invest in. While they admired our shared passion for sustainability and approaching it through reducing supermarket packaging waste, they wanted us to confidently show them a market demand for a solution in this space.The concerns that they shared with us were ones that we as a team shared, but didn’t put as much emphasis upon. However, we realized that to get the most out of the MEMSI experience, it was best for us to share the same emphasis as them. In that spirit, we fully embraced a full pivot and had another brainstorming session with a conscious effort to find a problem space different from what we started with.Knowing the time pressure that we would need to overcome given such a late pivot, we grinded away as much as we could and had a present a half-figured out idea to a new group of mentors. By the end of the day, we we all burnt and had to call it a night but came away with a new idea: FYI-DIY, a not-for-profit social enterprise platform that enables a community of home-improvement doers of all backgrounds to come together and share with one another their hacked tools that make common tasks easier in a 3D printable format.1.16: Most-nighterWith just a few days to fully flesh out this new idea, we continued to put in as much effort as we could today. In this accelerated timeline, we quickly went through all the exercises we did with our previous idea and split the variety of tasks up. We were short handed as Janice was out of commission due to a flu that spread throughout a majority of the MEMSI cohort. Tim and Ilona were in charge of the pitch and economic sustainability, Mike was in charge of the web-interface design, and Maggie and I were in charge of ideating, CADing, and fabricating as many solutions to common home improvement tasks as possible as an example of what people would find on our platform.While the Node had quite a few 3D printers, as every team started to reach the point in their progress that they were ready to make physical prototypes, we quickly learned that access to them would be limited as some started breaking down for a plethora a reasons and prints would range anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours to finish. With this in mind, I ended staying at the Node until around 2:30AM to get a final print started before leaving.Ultimaker starting to print at 3 am1.17: All-nighterThe grind continued today to make sure that we had enough time to make some final updates on anything that didn’t work or could be improved. While we got Janice back to help out with the web interface and slides design, Maggie caught the flu bug and couldn’t come in today. With me as the only person on the team with some CAD experience and the low availability of printers, I ended up staying overnight to get as many prints in as possible. By the end of the day, we were in a pretty good place with several different designs for a few common DIY tasks, a web interface framework, and a skeleton of a pitch and slides with plenty of content to fill it out.A fully 3D printed design of a potential tool to help with DIY painting 1.18 Polish Polish PolishWith today being the last day to work out the last kinks in our work, the name of the game today was polish! I took two hours today off to go back to my hotel room to shower and nap after the long day yesterday. My team put in amazing work throughout the day, putting together a compelling pitch complete with a clear strategy to sustain our social enterprise economically and market research that demonstrated the readiness to adopt something like our platform. I join the slides design team and spent the rest of the day catching up on the presentation and helping clean up our slide deck.One of the slides from our presentation!1.19: ShowcaseToday was the day! After a long two weeks and two long nights, we were as confident in our final solution as we could be. In a 7 minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of Q&A in front of a panel of judges coming from a variety of backgrounds ranging from a partner in venture capital firm to brand directors and professors along with an audience of about 100 family and friends, we presented FIY-DIY.A huge congratulations to team ATEM who won the judges award who worked to redefine the asthma inhaler to be a sleeker design integrated with a variety of smart features.We were honored to share the Audience Choice Award with them! Our team owes many thanks to all the instructors, TAs, and mentors who helped us out throughout our journey and gave us all invaluable feedback.The team after a successful launch!      PreviousMEMSI – The Startup 101 NextMEMSI – The Wonderful World of Manufacturing MEMSIIn The News January 27, 2019 | MEMSI | ceemit MEMSI – The Product January 26, 2019 | MEMSI | ceemit MEMSI – The Wonderful World of Manufacturing January 26, 2019 | MEMSI | ceemit MEMSI – The Process January 25, 2019 | MEMSI | ceemit MEMSI – The Startup 101 January 9, 2019 | MEMSI | ceemit MEMSI – The Setup Subscribe to our newsletter Email* PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

The new synthetic fibers’ proteins were created by genetically modifying bacteria to mimic the traditional proteins produced by spiders. This research, a blend of simulations and experiments, “paves the way for creating new fibers with improved characteristics beyond those of natural silk,” said Buehler. Published this week in the journal Nature Communications, this work presents a new way to generate strong and tough materials from abundant resources and at low energy, and could lead to a variety of new bio-inspired materials – including new composites, or sutures and scaffolding for organ replacements.

Co-sponsored by ILP and organized around a theme of innovation and collaboration, the conference highlighted the growing need for creative, cross-sector problem-solving to address significant food and water security issues around the world.  As the challenges involved in providing safe and sufficient supplies of food and water to an ever-growing and increasingly urban world population multiply, multisector partnerships and collaborations are becoming increasingly important for addressing system-level issues, as well as promoting the development and adoption of new technologies.  Following opening remarks by Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security (J-WAFS) director John Lienhard, who introduced J-WAFS as MIT’s Institute-wide initiative to coordinate and lead research related to water and food, keynote speaker Ralph Jerome, vice president for innovation for Mars, Inc., noted the significant role that the agriculture sector plays in climate change and how “uncommon collaborations” can help address the system-level challenges we face.  “Food and agriculture are not only a major contributor to climate change but probably also one of the areas that will be most hit by it,” he noted. “While innovation is important to sustain a business, it’s also crucial in a world facing the grand challenges of feeding a growing population, apportioning ample fresh water to all, bringing degraded lands back to production, decreasing food waste, and creating civilization that’s resilient to climate change.”  J-WAFS organized the day-and-a-half program, which highlighted innovative water, food, and agriculture technologies under development at MIT, including current research by MIT faculty as well as numerous startups with MIT affiliations. Professor Christopher Voigt of the Department of Biological Engineering, for instance, presented his J-WAFS-funded research on transferring the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of legumes to cereal grain crops. Currently, grain crops — particularly rice, wheat, and corn — require the addition of nitrogen to the soil, resulting in environmental impacts in places like North America, where over-fertilization can lead to problems such as algal blooms, as well as dramatically lower crop yields in places like Africa, where chemical fertilizer is beyond the economic reach of many farmers. Noting that this challenge was identified as far back as the late 1970s as “one of the two biggest problems for genetic engineering to solve,” he described recent advances in his lab that have addressed some of the most significant technical hurdles.  Karen Gleason, associate provost and the Alexander and I. Michael Kasser Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering, addressed the challenge of food- and water-borne pathogens, noting that the World Health Organization estimates that one in 10 people worldwide fall ill every year from eating contaminated food, and 420,000 deaths are attributed to these pathogens. Using chemiresistor technology that her lab has developed for a variety of applications, she is developing biosensors that can detect pathogens in food in real-time using quick and easy sample preparation. With a very low detection limit, this technology would represent a significant improvement over conventional methods. Two other keynote speakers addressed the need to connect appropriate technologies to markets. “How do you connect the technology to the market in order to get the innovation to the end user?” asked Kavita Prakash-Mani, who is leading Grow Asia, a new initiative of the World Economic Forum. She described the agriculture sector as the “largest economic driver globally, with the largest environmental impact from any sector, and also the biggest social impact given the number of people working in it.” Yet the majority of the world’s 550 million farmers are smallholder farmers, and many of them are chronically hungry themselves. Noting that farmers can be very averse to change, she emphasized the need to work collaboratively with them to design and implement new technologies.  In addition to innovation and technology development, the conference also featured a panel addressing “Risk and Resilience in an Era of Globalization and Climate Change.” Moderated by Steve Polski, senior director and general manager for Cargill’s Responsible Supply Chains Joint Advisory Business, the panel featured professors and researchers from MIT who address various threats to the world’s agriculture and food supply chains.  Colette Heald, the Mitsui Career Development Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, who also holds an appointment in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, talked about the impact of both air pollution and climate change on future crop yields, and stressed the need for better environmental monitoring to understand the risks. Retsef Levi, a professor in the MIT Sloan School of Management, addressed food safety as a supply chain issue, and Alexis Bateman, director of MIT’s Responsible Supply Chain Lab, emphasized the importance of bringing more transparency and honesty to international supply chains in order to help companies control risk related to supply, reputation, and environmental impact. Addressing a question to the panel about how education and research can help reduce corporate and social risk, Levi stressed the role of MIT’s industry connections in taking research to the field, and all panelists agreed about the importance of interdisciplinary research and the need to pursue research related to real-world issues.  The conference also featured a keynote by Tim Prewitt, executive director of International Development Enterprises (iDE). Kicking off a panel on agricultural technologies, he noted that the extremes in crop productivity across the world suggest huge opportunities to grow more food with improvements in technology and farming methods — particularly in places like Sub-Saharan Africa, where soils are depleted, there is only rain-fed irrigation, and crop yields are lowest. Addressing the need for innovation in business markets as well as technology, he noted that the “single biggest consideration is how to get products to market quickly and cheaply.”  That is also the interest of the many startup companies that participated in the conference’s startup showcase. Conference attendees had the opportunity to talk with representatives of nearly two dozen companies. Some, such as the young agricultural drone company Raptor Maps, were only recently started by MIT students, and others, such as Desalitech, a company offering large-scale water purification and desalination technology, already have substantial capitalization and business volume. Desalitech is currently licensing several patents pertaining to desalination, low-energy deslination, and membrane technology from MIT.  Commenting on J-WAFS’ role at MIT, director John Lienhard described one of its programs, J-WAFS Solutions, which supports the commercialization of MIT technologies and provides support and mentorship for MIT faculty and students around food and water innovation and entrepreneurship. “We heard over and over at the conference about the importance of not just innovating, but building successful companies, enterprises, and collaborations that enable those innovations to make a difference in the world,” he said. “The success of this conference signals the growing interest the MIT community has in applying MIT’s excellent track record in this regard to our food and water security challenges.”  PreviousCrowdsourcing the Silver Line commute NextCEE announces three new professorships 2016 News ReleasesIn The News July 11, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Making India’s waste streams sustainable June 30, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Microscale marine interactions may shape critical carbon cycles June 20, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offering new minors, subjects this fall June 20, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit New Access MIT program offers free public transit to MIT employees June 8, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Finding a new formula for concrete June 8, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit MIT at the Venice Biennale Subscribe to our newsletter Email* PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Recently, a team including Dr. Zhao Qin, Professor Markus Buehler and Course 1 sophomore Mary Hwang have revealed for the first time that only two percent of the surface area of graphene is affected by wrinkles. To confirm this result, Zhao and Hwang have conducted an atom-by-atom analysis of the mechanics of graphene wrinkling, and developed a continuum mechanics model for different graphene geometries, sizes and loading conditions. This study provides important insights into the deformation of graphene, as well as efficient tools for designing the next generation of graphene nano-electronics.

Consider areas such as design, energy, and materials: These core concepts associated with sustainability are part of an integrative spectrum of widespread innovation. “Sustainability is a fashion nowadays,” says Oral Buyukozturk, professor of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) at MIT. “But the concept is often used so loosely that many people are unsure of what it really means.” With a particular focus on mechanics, the durability of construction materials, and sound design, Buyukozturk has catalyzed several multidisciplinary ventures in CEE — all with the goal of advancing the science and engineering of quantifiably sustainable designs for infrastructure. He maintains that science and engineering are the entitites that keep skyscrapers erect, materials resilient, and infrastructure intact. “Physical and civil infrastructures inevitably deteriorate over time,” Buyukozturk says. “Construction material deterioration is a global problem, and we are faced with two challenges: How do we rehabilitate and repair existing structures, and how do we build new systems that are more durable under today’s conditions?” His work in the sustainability of the built environment strives to provide solutions. Determined to clarify the concept of sustainability in engineering terms, Buyukozturk launched the Laboratory for Infrastructure Science and Sustainability (LISS) in 2011.  Now home to a group of correlating initiatives, LISS aims to contribute to societal and economic development through detailing the sustainability of existing physical infrastructures and enhancing the design of new systems. LISS encompasses several interrelated initiatives including motion sensing and distributed wireless sensor networks, construction material innovation, infrastructure energy efficiency, as well as new design paradigms in earthquake engineering. LISS broadly communicates its discoveries and new technologies through the presentation of papers in international conferences on structural health monitoring, earthquake engineering and seismology, as well as publication in journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.How materials break: SEM image of interfacial debonding in an epoxy-silica bonded system with Cr super layerLISS tackles the sustainability of Kuwait’s built environmentAmong the research initiatives gathered under the LISS umbrella, one of the most ambitious is the Sustainability of Kuwait’s Built Environment (SKBE). The mission, coined as the first Kuwait-MIT Signature Project, was announced on March 13, 2013.Bringing together more than 30 MIT and Kuwaiti researchers, as well as an army of graduate students from every corner of MIT, this team endeavors to generate innovations in building materials, sensing, energy efficiency, resiliency, and urban planning. Incorporating a myriad of fields, “the overall objective is the development of innovative solutions and methodologies for the sustainability of Kuwait’s built environment in extreme conditions,” says Buyukozturk, the lead principal investigator of SKBE. The final product will be a blueprint for the future of Kuwait’s built environment. “The project greatly contributes to the energy and life cycle efficiency of materials, buildings, and neighborhoods using a unique multiscale approach to urban planning. It will benefit Kuwait in its future city developments and improve energy utilization of existing buildings and towns with a perspective towards renewable energy concepts,” says Ali Hajiah, research scientist at the Energy and Building Research Center of KISR, and co-principal investigator of the Signature Project. SKBE evolved after years of interaction between MIT and Kuwaiti scientists from the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research and Kuwait University, and is funded with a $4.97 million grant through the Kuwait-MIT Center for Natural Resources and the Environment (CNRE) by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences. The beauty, says Buyukozturk, is its ensemble of “hot topic” challenges: steep population growth, seismic ground motion, hazardous weather conditions, energy conversion, and future energy depletion. The real-world implementations for the salvage and utilization of an ultimate energy system for Kuwait are vast, he adds. “To my knowledge, this is a unique program of this scope, dealing with issues of this size,” Buyukozturk says. “The challenge is getting everybody working together toward sustainability — not just talking about it, but creating solutions.”  In response to the Kuwaiti government’s call for an integrated approach to updating its infrastructure, the plan encompasses three research thrusts: nanoengineered construction materials, performance-based engineering and reliability and energy efficiency, and life-cycle performance of construction materials and buildings in Kuwait. “As several infrastructure projects are to be implemented based on Kuwait’s Master plan, this distinctive signature project which is divided into three related thrust areas will provide significant scientific knowledge and benefits to Kuwait for future infrastructure systems, retrofitting existing infrastructures, education, economic, and construction industry,” says Hasan Kamal, member of Kuwait Municipal Council, coordinator and a co-PI of the project.  “In addition to its benefits to the Gulf region, the outcomes of the project will be used to modify standards, regulations, and codes.” SKBE creates durable, construction materialsOne example of the project’s success is its development of concrete made to weather the elements with less degradation than that currently used in much of Kuwaiti construction. “At Kuwait University we have powerful techniques like solid-state 600-NMR, N2/H2O sorptiometry, Raman spectroscopy, and Nanoindentation. For the first time and through this unique project we are implementing these techniques in cement characterization and optimization,” says Professor Ali Bumajdad, vice dean for academic and graduate studies of Kuwait University, a supervisor of KU’s Nanoscopy Science Center, and a co-PI of the project. Through an iterative process that combines experimentation and the type of multi-scale computational modeling led by Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering head Markus Buehler, the SKBE team is developing a cement paste composition that incorporates volcanic ash — a material found throughout the Persian Gulf region/Arabian peninsula. Concrete made with this composition is less porous and resistant to water penetration and serves the team’s sustainability objectives. “We [in SKBE] incorporate the biological materials studied in Professor Buehler’s group into construction and building materials,” says Steven Palkovic, CEE graduate student and SKBE collaborator. “This work is innovative because it’s one of the first attempts at a multi-scale approach for cement base materials and an ongoing effort to apply lessons from biological materials to one of the most widely used construction building materials in the world.” According to Buyukozturk, this effort will save Kuwait and future missions both money and energy. “This is a new concept, using locally available material to replace part of the cement to create a material that behaves better, involves less manufacturing costs, and lasts longer,” he says. The vision of the project is to leverage the basic science capabilities of computational materials modeling and simulation in conjunction with current experimental techniques to meet the specific technological challenges of Kuwait. It is a first step, says Buyukozturk, “of a model for sustainable solutions to materials and for structures.” Regulating the infrastructure response to the environmentSensors that detect subtle building behaviors such as twisting, vibrating, and rocking can potentially identify structural damage or weakness before a disaster occurs. Within the SKBE’s scope, sensor networks are being installed on the Al Hamra tower in Kuwait City, the world’s tallest sculptured building, to monitor its seismic behavior and any environmental effects. “We build a full-scale finite element model to study the dynamic characteristics of this unique tower and carry out optimal sensor placement analysis before instrumentation,” says CEE postdoc Hao Sun. “The objective of optimal sensor placement is to obtain as much information of the structure as possible given a limited number of sensors in practical structural health monitoring.” GPS units and accelerometers have also been placed around Kuwait to measure building movement. “We installed two GPS units in Al Hamra to continuously monitor the motion and displacement of the building,” says Tom Herring, a GPS specialist and professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “The GPS is potentially able to monitor the building’s dynamic behavior in real time which tells us the seismic and environmental effect on the building and helps us to evaluate the building safety.” A special objective of SKBE is to examine seismic loads applied to tall buildings and superstructures in Kuwait. “Regional earthquakes are important safety-threatening factors to buildings in Kuwait,” says Nafi Toksoz, EAPS professor and co-PI. “With the performance-based engineering concepts, we investigate robust methodologies for local ground-motion calculation to provide data for building-response modeling and performance prediction.” These new technologies, says Buyukozturk, can inform decisions about renovating current infrastructure for safety and reliability and can help with tailoring future building systems to achieve maximum energy efficiencies and sturdiness. Enhancing the energy efficiency and life-cycle performance of infrastructureArchitects are taking the lead on SKBE’s third research focus area. One team member, Christoph Reinhart, associate professor in MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, is applying sustainable design simulations and planning models to the large-scale laboratory of Kuwait. With MIT students and Kuwaiti colleagues, Reinhart is mapping each residence in a typical neighborhood of Kuwait City to determine energy use of occupants as well as each unit’s embodied energy use (the energy required to build and maintain a structure over its lifespan). His group is also plotting the “walkability” of city neighborhoods, the proximity and accessibility of stores, parks, and other sites to travelers on foot. This research will provide planning guidance to the government of Kuwait, which is currently under extreme pressure from a rapidly expanding population and its own commitment to provide affordable housing to Kuwaitis. “What we’re really doing here is creating evidence-based design tools they can use today,” Reinhart says. “If we can say that over the next decade, this is how much energy is going to be used in buildings, Kuwaitis can make strategic decisions, such as deciding to retrofit older buildings with photovoltaics or more insulated windows, or deploy new building materials that keep buildings cooler in the summer.” Reinhart’s research reveals tradeoffs that may come into play as Kuwait makes choices about sustainable construction. Well-designed high-rise buildings, which his models suggest are the most energy-efficient and enhance neighborhood walkability, do not prove as amenable to daylighting — a technology that uses natural light from windows to reduce the need for artificial light sources. Increased density of buildings, better for energy savings, may cramp Kuwaitis’ desire for comfortable living spaces. However Kuwait decides to use this work, Reinhart views his neighborhood modeling as “an exciting new energy policy tool that can have a gigantic impact,” he says, especially as it gets deployed on larger scales. In addition, John Ochsendorf, the Class of 1942 Professor in MIT’s departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Architecture, is working together with Reinhart to quantify the environmental impact of construction materials in Kuwait. The goal is to identify opportunities for energy savings in both the operation and the construction of buildings. According to Ochsendorf, “this project provides an integrated approach to the planning and design of low-energy cities for the future.”  SKBE was originally expected to run for three years, says Buyukozturk. Now in its third year, he hints that the project’s natural continuation will extend past the formerly anticipated deadline. “The indications are that with this extension they [Kuwait] would see increased benefits from the intellectual framework and development we have created with this project,” he explains. “Particularly, they would like us to continue into the extension of physical implementation of the blueprint we have created.” SKBE represents a first step toward demonstrating the benefits of the alliance synergy, and is an effort to provide a science foundation for a set of technologies addressing the safety and efficiency of Kuwait’s built infrastructure. “As the success of SKBE depends on creating solutions specific to the Kuwait conditions, it also illustrates a principle underlying any science-based transformation of technological enterprises in our society — connecting the push from science advances (global) to the pull from technology demands (local),” says Professor Sidney Yip, a co-investigator of the project in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. From providing detailed maps of energy usage to the fabrication of durable construction materials for robust infrastructure that withstands the elements, Buyukozturk said Kuwait’s quantifiably sustainable designs, along with the other LISS initiatives, “are going to be a very big thing.”  PreviousMIT Clean Earth Hackathon Breaks Convention to Foster Innovative Ideas for Industry NextBuilding a More Resilient NYC through Big Engineering 2015 News ReleasesIn The News December 23, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Pushing engineering boundaries to spur infrastructure innovation December 21, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT’s Buehler and Reis elected to Society of Engineering Science Board of Directors December 18, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Sharing best practices for getting published in science December 14, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT Transit Leaders Roundtable opens a discussion on transportation challenges December 14, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT community and others recently joined together for a weekend to solve current industry energy challenges December 7, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Stretchable hydrogel electronics Subscribe to our newsletter Email* EmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

(Up until a few weeks ago, we were working on getting the MATLAB model working with the current state of the highway, and now we are modeling the hypothetical.) The Ayalon is a private highway in Israel, and we were able to use un-implemented plans for HOT lanes, sent to us directly from the Ayalon office, in designing the HOT lanes for our model.Actually designing the HOT roads (e.g. figuring out where the lane should separate from the highway and where it should come back together) brought to my attention all the different factors that go into planning roads. For example, if the HOT lane is all the way on the left, and the road is splitting off in different directions, how do you design the HOT lane to also split in those directions while keeping it on the left?In addition to the TransModeler design, I spent the past few weeks finalizing the MATLAB code that I wrote. I mainly wrote two programs; one program is used to convert the format of the TransModeler output into something that we can use; the other program calculates the average travel times along different routes in the simulation.I want to thank everyone who has welcomed me at the Technion! It was a really great experience, and I recommend that any undergraduate reading this to take some time to focus on a single project — either during the summer or a semester — because learning outside of the classroom is invaluable, and you’ll return to the classroom feeling refreshed.The Technion Civil & Environmental Engineering Dean threw a pool party for the whole department! Outside a very scenic spot in HaifaAmy Vogel ’20 is studying abroad in Israel at the Technion this semester, where she is working alongside Tomer Toledo, PhD ’03. Her abroad experiences have been facilitated by MISTI MIT-Israel.

Collaboration further enhances idea generation through shared insights, experiences, and ingenuity. Add to the mix a sense of urgency, and entrepreneurial minds quickly begin to improve lives, protect the earth, and shape new global economies.MIT’s Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) department in collaboration with Sustainability@MIT recently held its first Clean Earth Hackathon to encourage just this sort of creative disruption. It brought the MIT and non-MIT communities together to focus on real-world environmental challenges. Students and professionals alike converged on campus to meet, share, and brainstorm new opportunities for industry that can be put to use immediately. The hackathon, sponsored by the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), and the Student Activity Office was held, appropriately, over Earth Day weekend, on April 17-19, 2015. Typically, hackathons allow participants to pick their own projects, but the Clean Earth Hackathon instead engaged with public, private and non-private organizations to identify a slate of challenges. Eight companies and organizations—including the consulting firm McKinsey, waste recycler Casella, research and environmental consulting group, the Rocky Mountain Institute, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)—were among the entities invited to challenge the 70+ participants to solve their organization’s most pressing real-world sustainability problems. The four winning teams were each awarded $1,000 and selected from among four broad challenge areas: Natural Resource Management, Environmentally-Conscious Design, Mobility in the Modern World, and Refueling the Next Generation.Ready, Set, GoBusiness Development Manager Liza Casella of New England-based Casella Waste Systems, a presenter and judge, explained that glass is a big component of her company’s recycling stream. Glass today, however, represents a very low value, high cost product in a curbside recycling environment. She and the other judges awarded a prize to Team Gramber for its scalable solution that helps evaluate the risk and reward of using a glass imploder to refurbish glass waste and produce fiberglass and concrete.“This is the kind of innovative thinking we were hoping to spark with our challenge,” said Casella. “A solution that my company can begin working with right away.”CEE Department Head Markus Buehler said the idea of the hackathon came directly from students last year during his Town Hall meetings. Galvanized by MIT CEE doctoral students Hanny Rivera and Jessica Bryant, the coordinating committee spent much of the school year targeting the right industry and government representatives to help frame the session. “Teams organized themselves around complementary skills and talents,” said Buehler. “Their solutions epitomized what ‘Big Engineering’ is all about—producing large-scale impact on people and sustainability, covering a spectrum of activities from environment to systems to infrastructure. Our new 1-ENG undergraduate program trains students in this mindset, so it was natural that the hackathon build upon it.”Course 1 PhD candidate David Hagan said he was incented to give up his weekend to hack alongside a friend on a real-world challenge. “My team included someone from Harvard, my fellow Kroll group member Mark Goldman, and even an MIT alumnus who runs his own business tech solutions company,” said Hagan. “Although we didn’t win, we helped reimagine, recode, and refine the MassOTA’s public online tool known as the Energy and Materials Flow and Cost Tracker. The agency’s goal was to leverage crowdsourcing to finish this four-year-old app, but the tool really needed some remedial work to interest and draw others in.”“I had great professors when I earned my doctorate at MIT,” said Mohan Venkataramana CH ‘86, the MIT alum on Hagan’s team. “I’m here to pay it forward by offering my real world experiences and business skills. In return, I enjoy learning from the students, too.” Some people chose to work on a project that overlapped two or more of the four challenge areas. For instance, McKinsey Consulting challenged the teams to unlock the value of the ‘Circular Economy’ by bringing products, materials or components back into the economy. Working alone, clean energy professional and Babson College MBA, Adam Ostaszewski, studied the U.S. craft brewing industry and created a natural resources management tool that can help brewers make better informed decisions about environment impacts on business economics. One of his recommendations was encouraging the “canned craft beer revolution”–substituting environmentally-conscious aluminum cans for glass beer bottles—potentially saving the earth while improving profits.Future EventRivera and Bryant said they are considering moving the Clean Earth Hackathon to the beginning of the school year in the fall. They believe it might help students better prepare for and conceptualize proposals for the global MIT IDEAS Global Challenge and other startup contests that run through the school year.Clean Earth Hackathon Spring 2015 WinnersTeam “Gramber” won for its proposal of innovative sustainable solutions for glass recycling and reuse by Casella LLC. Members included Anna Cheimets, Olivia Hentz, Qifang Bao, and Brendan Smith.Team “Cosmopolitan” suggested multiple ways to help the MassDOT better understand cycling movements in the Commonwealth and help it reach its goal of tripling the amount of travel by walking, biking and riding the MBTA by 2030. The team offered infrastructure and systems solutions, including the creation of a new app bikers could use to record their movements which could be anonymized for research and planning. The team consisted of Leo Blondel, Clara Nicolai, Raphaël Tackx, Finn Stirling, and Amy Jobe.Team “Patagonia Efficiency REV” proposed a sustainable solution for the Patagonia Conservancy, a new national park in Chile, to be fossil fuel independent. One of the team’s innovative suggestions was for the park to store hydrogen in the off-season for use during peak times. Participants included Evgeny Logvinov, Rachit Kansal, and Payal Loungani.Team “CoalMap” won for its interactive map that evaluates cost-effectiveness of closing down U.S. coal plants. The team created a dynamic application that tracks each plant’s return on investment for switching to a more sustainable energy source. Participants were David Borrelli, Fanni Fan, Joel Jean, and Tony Wu.

Now, scientists at MIT have developed a systematic approach to research its structure, blending computational modeling and mechanical analysis to 3D-print synthetic spider webs. These models offer insight into how spiders optimize their own webs.“This is the first methodical exploration of its kind,” says Professor Markus Buehler, head of MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), and the lead author of a paper appearing this week in Nature Communications. “We are looking to expand our knowledge of the function of natural webs in a systematic and repeatable manner.”Coupling multiscale modeling with emerging microscale 3D-printing techniques, the team enabled a pathway to directly fabricate and test synthetic web structures by design. The lessons learned through this approach may help harness spider silk’s strength for other uses, and ultimately inspire engineers to digitally design new structures and composites that are reliable and damage-resistant.The paper was written by Buehler, along with CEE research scientist Zhao Qin, Harvard University professor Jennifer Lewis, and former Harvard postdoc Brett Compton.Further unraveling the mysteries of spider silkThe study unearths a significant relationship between spider web structure, loading points, and failure mechanisms. By adjusting the material distribution throughout an entire web, a spider is able to optimize the web’s strength for its anticipated prey.The team, adopting an experimental setup, used metal structures to 3D-print synthetic webs, and directly integrate their data into models. “Ultimately we merged the physical with the computational in our experiments,” Buehler says.According to Buehler, spider webs employ a limited amount of material to capture prey of different sizes. He and his colleagues hope to use this work to design real-world, damage-resistant materials of lower density.The 3D-printed models, Lewis says, open the door to studying the effects of web architecture on strength and damage tolerance — a feat that would have been impossible to achieve using only natural spider webs.“Spider silk is an impressive and fascinating material,” she says. “But before now, the role of the web architecture had not yet been fully explored.” To investigate the geometric aspects of spider webs through the use of a similar material to silk that can be 3D-printed with uniform mechanical properties was Lewis’ mission.Buehler’s team used orb-weaver spider webs as the inspiration for their 3-D designs. In each of their samples, they controlled the diameter of the thread as a method of comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous thread thickness.In simulation, the team created “the ideal environment to test and optimize the web structures” under different loading conditions, and then use synthetic materials to print identical webs, Qin says. “We are on the way to quantifying the mechanism that makes the spider’s web so strong,” he says.The work revealed that spider webs consisting of uniform thread diameters are better suited to bear force applied at a single point, such as the impact coming from flies hitting webs; a nonuniform diameter can withstand more widespread pressure, such as from wind, rain, or gravity.The combination of computational modeling and 3D-printing makes it possible to test and optimize designs efficiently.“This work is an excellent demonstration of how we can exploit designs in nature in the development of novel materials and structures.” says Sandra Shefelbine, an associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern University not involved in this work.Marc Meyers, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of California at San Diego, adds: “Biological materials and structures are the new frontier of engineering. This most recent significant contribution by Markus Buehler and colleagues goes beyond the first stage, which is to understand nature, and make significant inroads into creating a bioinspired structure.”Lewis says that the team now plans to examine the dynamic aspects of webs through controlled impact and vibration experiments. This, she says, will change the printed material’s properties in real time, opening the door to printing optimized, multifunctional structures.  PreviousBuilding a More Resilient NYC through Big Engineering NextCEE Announces Faculty Promotions 2015 News ReleasesIn The News December 23, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Pushing engineering boundaries to spur infrastructure innovation December 21, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT’s Buehler and Reis elected to Society of Engineering Science Board of Directors December 18, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Sharing best practices for getting published in science December 14, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT Transit Leaders Roundtable opens a discussion on transportation challenges December 14, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit MIT community and others recently joined together for a weekend to solve current industry energy challenges December 7, 2015 | 2015 News Releases | ceemit Stretchable hydrogel electronics Subscribe to our newsletter Email* EmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

The new benefits include free, unlimited subway and local bus usage, and increased subsidies for parking at MBTA stations and commuter rail tickets. The Access MIT pass is a reflection of the Institute’s commitment to sustainability and climate action, and will be accompanied by a shift to pay-per-day parking at most lots in an effort to reduce the number of cars on campus. The Access MIT program is an initiative to create a variety of affordable, low-carbon transportation options and change the way the MIT community thinks about commuting. By connecting programs, education, decision-making, and modes of transportation, Access MIT strives to create a new awareness and shared understanding of transportation choices and their impacts. Detailed information about MIT’s commuter programs, including Hubway, ZipCar, and the AccessMyCommute tool, are available on the commuter benefits webpage. “Technology offers new strategies to change commuting behavior to the benefit of individuals, the Institute, and surrounding communities,” says Les Norford, the George Macomber Professor in Construction Management in the Department of Architecture, who sits on the Committee for Transportation and Parking. “Access MIT is a significant effort, on the part of many people, to make that change desirable and effective.” Need for a sustainable commuting solution In recent years, the area surrounding the MIT campus has become a growing innovation hub, attracting startups and global enterprises from around the world. With these organizations come new researchers, technologists, scientists, students, and entrepreneurs. In many ways, MIT is at the center of this innovation ecosystem. It is therefore a priority for the Institute to identify innovative ways to proactively address the livability of the area, for both the campus community and the surrounding neighborhoods. “The question is,” says Julie Newman, director of the Office of Sustainability, and member of the Transportation and Parking Committee, “How does MIT advance its mission in the most sustainable way? And how do we expand our academic initiatives while also minimizing our impact on the community and the environment?” A commitment to sustainable transit options is part of MIT’s response to questions like these. “MIT works very closely with stakeholders within the Institute, public sector, and in the community to develop smart, sustainable transportation alternatives, from sponsoring transit studies to addressing challenges in the MBTA system to working closely with the Kendall Square Association,” says Michael Owu, chair of the Committee for Transportation and Parking and director of Real Estate at the MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo). “We hope that other organizations will follow our lead and implement similar programs.” In a letter sent today to faculty and staff, Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz stated, “Access MIT embraces the goals of MIT’s Plan for Action on Climate Change, and is a visible demonstration of our commitment to lowering MIT’s commuter-related emissions.” He added, “With Access MIT, the Institute will be one of the largest employers in the state to provide this level of universal transit benefits.” Ruiz thanked the members of the Committee for Transportation and Parking for their dedication in bringing these new commuting options to MIT’s campus. Becoming a living lab to change commuter behavior Over the past seven years, the MIT Transit Lab, in collaboration with the Parking and Transportation Office, has focused on how faculty, staff, students, and visitors travel to and from MIT. One particular challenge was the total cost of building and/or maintaining parking spaces in and around the MIT campus — and whether this could be offset by improving commuter awareness of the problem and incentivizing new behavior. In 2010 the Parking and Transportation Office, in conjunction with the Transit Lab, launched a pilot program called the MIT Mobility Pass. This represented an exciting, first-of-its-kind collaboration between MIT and the MBTA. The pilot involved approximately 1,000 MIT employees who typically parked on campus, and allowed these employees to access MBTA subways and local buses at no additional cost to them, providing new daily options for commuting to campus. Based on the success of the pilot, MIT has decided to expand the program to include all benefits-eligible MIT faculty and staff at the Cambridge campus. By becoming a “living lab,” the research team believes that this program may represent a new model for managing commuter demand within densely populated areas. The Access MIT pass program Supported by the initial research conducted by the Transit Lab, MIT has set out to reduce parking demand on campus by 10 percent over the next two years with the launch of the new program, which combines pay-per-day parking for most parkers with free access to MBTA subway and local bus, among other benefits.  “The decision used to be whether to buy an annual pass and drive every day, or not,” notes John Attanucci, research associate and manager of the MIT Transit Research Program. “With this new approach, commuters will be able to drive one day then ride the T the next and save money in parking fees. By having options, we can begin changing the way people think about commuting.” To make it easy for MIT employees to use the new MBTA benefits through the Access MIT pass program, CharlieCard chips will be embedded directly into new MIT ID cards. In addition to providing free subway and local bus access to all benefits-eligible faculty and staff on the Cambridge campus, the new program eliminates the need for most parkers to purchase the annual permits that financially commit them to driving for the entire year. This gives commuters the flexibility to choose, day-to-day, how they get to campus. Andrea Campbell, the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor and head of the Department of Political Science, and co-chair of the Sustainability Taskforce, comments, “Faculty and staff often ask how they can make an individual contribution to the global climate challenge. This is an exciting opportunity for community members to use their commute as a way to take action toward combatting a big problem.”The new commuter benefits program will include:Free MBTA subway and local bus access via CharlieCard chips embedded in new MIT ID cards; A shift from annual contracts to daily parking at most MIT gated lots, with total maximum expense capped at the annual parking rate (currently $1,760 for 2016-17); Increased commuter rail subsidy from 50 percent to 60 percent; Subsidized parking of 50 percent at MBTA stations, up to $100 per month.Monthly LinkPass holders will no longer be required to pay 50 percent of the monthly fee, and employees who bike, walk, or drive to campus will be able to ride the T free anytime. “By putting people first, we’ve been able to create a collection of programs — everything from unrestricted T passes to emergency ride assistance — that give virtually everyone at MIT more than one way to get to campus,” says Newman. “It’s about developing transportation literacy and providing options so people get to make an informed choice, each day, about how they commute.” Also launched recently, in collaboration with the Transit Lab, is an online tool that informs and encourages new commuting options. AccessMyCommute is an online dashboard that allows commuters to compare transit modes and analyze their carbon footprint. It also uses points, rewards, and incentives to encourage the use of public transportation and carpooling, as well as walking and biking to work. Access MIT and the new MIT ID card The rollout of this program relies on the issuance of new MIT ID cards that have CharlieCard chips embedded in them. All benefits-eligible faculty and staff at the Cambridge campus wishing to take advantage of the new Access MIT pass need to proactively upgrade their ID cards in one of two ways. Over the summer, employees can visit the MIT Card Office in Room W20-021 to obtain their new IDs. Starting in June, the Parking and Transportation Office will offer on-site visits to departments to swap IDs. New IDs will be activated when issued, so credentials and permissions will transfer, and faculty and staff will have immediate access to their MBTA benefits. The MIT Parking and Transportation Office will share more details about Access MIT in the weeks to come. For more information on the program, and to learn about how to obtain a new MIT ID card, visit web.mit.edu/accessmit.  PreviousFinding a new formula for concrete NextDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering offering new minors, subjects this fall 2016 News ReleasesIn The News July 11, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Making India’s waste streams sustainable June 30, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Microscale marine interactions may shape critical carbon cycles June 20, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offering new minors, subjects this fall June 20, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit New Access MIT program offers free public transit to MIT employees June 8, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit Finding a new formula for concrete June 8, 2016 | 2016 News Releases | ceemit MIT at the Venice Biennale Subscribe to our newsletter Email* NameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
