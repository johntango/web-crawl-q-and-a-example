GPTsUsers can create and share access to their own customized versions of ChatGPT called âGPTsâ.For Builders of GPTs:(a) GPT Content. The information that you include with your GPT (for example your GPT name and description) is your Content. As between you and OpenAI, you are solely responsible for Output that is based on the instructions, content, custom actions, and configurations that you use or enable to create your GPT. You must ensure your GPT complies with the Agreement and our Usage Policies.Â (b) Actions. If you enable your GPT to interact with an API, website, or service (an âActionâ) you own or control, then you must comply with our Plugins and Actions Terms. If you enable your GPT to interact with an Action owned or controlled by a third party, you are responsible for ensuring that any collection, use, or transmission of any information from any user of your GPT to the third party is authorized by the user.(c) Removal. We may remove or refuse to make any GPT available on our Services at any time without notice to you for (i) legal, fraud and abuse prevention, or security reasons or (ii) if your GPT otherwise violates our Terms.Â Â (d) Use of âGPTâ. Subject to our brand guidelines, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the name âGPTâÂ to create your own GPT. You may not imply that we create, support, or endorse your GPT without our prior written consent.Â For Users of GPTs:(a) Third Party GPTs. Except where OpenAI is identified as the builder of a GPT, GPTs are created by other users and they may rely on content or third party applications that are not controlled by OpenAI. Only use GPTs that you know and trust.(b) Abuse Reporting. You can report GPTs that violate our Usage Policies using our reporting feature within ChatGPT.(c) Custom Actions. GPTs may allow you to interact with Actions. Those Actions are subject to our terms for Plugins and Actions below.(d) Changes and Removal. OpenAI and creators of GPTs can remove GPTs at any time without prior notice.6. Image CapabilitiesOur models can accept images as part of Inputs to the Service (âImage Capabilitiesâ).(a) Not for Medical Advice. Image Capabilities are not designed or intended to be used as a medical device or to perform any medical function and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, or judgment.Â (b) Images with People. You may not use Image Capabilities to assist in identifying a person or to solicit or infer private or sensitive information about a person.7. Plugins and Actions(a) Overview. Plugins and Actions (together âPluginsâ) are features in ChatGPT that allow you to send instructions to and receive information from another application or website (âApplicationâ) while using our Services. Each Plugin is made available by the developer of the Application, which is typically a third party not affiliated with OpenAI. You may take action on an Application through one or more Plugins. For example, you may enable a plugin for a restaurant reservation website to request a reservation via the Services. You are solely responsible for the actions you take using Plugins. You must manually enable each plugin, which allows the applicable Service to access and use the enabled plugin. OpenAI may (but will have no obligation) to review, refuse, or remove Applications from ChatGPT. However, by using Plugins, you may be exposed to Applications or content that you may find offensive, inappropriate or objectionable. You agree that you use Plugins at your own risk. DO NOT ENABLE A PLUGIN UNLESS YOU KNOW AND TRUST THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION AND HAVE REVIEWED ITS TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY.(b) Plugin Operation and Content. When you enable a plugin, the Services will send applicable portions of your Content and certain information such as your country and state (âPlugin Dataâ) via the plugin to the Application. By enabling the plugin, you authorize and instruct us to send your Plugin Data to the applicable Application, which will be handled in accordance with its terms. We are not responsible for Plugin Data after it has been provided to an Application other than Applications owned by us. The Plugin will retrieve information and content from the Application, which may be included in Output you receive from the Services. This information and content included in the Output is not owned by you or OpenAI, and may be subject to the terms of the Application.8. Voice ConversationsVoice conversations is a ChatGPT feature that allows you to speak to our models and have them speak back (âChatGPT Voice Outputâ). ChatGPT Voice Output is for non-commercial use only and may not be distributed or repackaged as a standalone audio recording or any other sound file. Any rights in Output assigned to you do not include ChatGPT Voice Output.ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "

The Terms include ourÂ Service Terms,Â Sharing & Publication Policy,Â Usage Policies, and other documentation, guidelines, or policies we may provide in writing.

Usage Requirements(a)Â Use of Services. You may access, and we grant you a non-exclusive right to use, the Services in accordance with these Terms. You will comply with these Terms and all applicable laws when using the Services. We and our affiliates own all rights, title, and interest in and toÂ theÂ Services.(b)Â Feedback. We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements. If you provide any of these things, we may use it without restriction or compensationÂ toÂ you.(c)Â Restrictions. You may not (i) use the Services in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates any personâs rights; (ii) reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, translate or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying components of models, algorithms, and systems of the Services (except to the extent such restrictions are contrary to applicable law); (iii) use output from the Services to develop models that compete with OpenAI; (iv) except as permitted through the API, use any automated or programmatic method to extract data or output from the Services, including scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction; (v) represent that output from the Services was human-generated when it is not or otherwise violate our Usage Policies; (vi) buy, sell, or transfer API keys without our prior consent; or (vii), send us any personal information of children under 13 or the applicable age of digital consent.

Any third party software, services, or other products you use in connection with the Services are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for thirdÂ partyÂ products.3. Content(a)Â Your Content. You may provide input to the Services (âInputâ), and receive output generated and returned by the Services based on the Input (âOutputâ). Input and Output are collectively âContent.â As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, OpenAI hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output. This means you can use Content for any purpose, including commercial purposes such as sale or publication, if you comply with these Terms. OpenAI may use Content to provide and maintain the Services, comply with applicable law, and enforce our policies. You are responsible for Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law orÂ theseÂ Terms.(b)Â Similarity of Content. Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for OpenAI or a third party. For example, you may provide input to a model such as âWhat color is the sky?â and receive output such as âThe sky is blue.â Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same response. Responses that are requested by and generated for other users are not consideredÂ yourÂ Content.(c)Â Use of Content to Improve Services. We do not use Content that you provide to or receive from our API (âAPI Contentâ) to develop or improve our Services. We may use Content from Services other than our API (âNon-API Contentâ) to help develop and improve our Services. You can read more here aboutÂ how Non-API Content may be used to improve model performance. If you do not want your Non-API Content used to improve Services, you can opt out by filling outÂ this form. Please note that in some cases this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your specificÂ useÂ case.(d) Accuracy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.4. Fees and Payments(a)Â Fees and Billing. You will pay all fees charged to your account (âFeesâ) according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise agreed between us in writing. We have the right to correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received payment. You will provide complete and accurate billing information including a valid and authorized payment method. We will charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic basis, but may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You authorize OpenAI and its affiliates, and our third-party payment processor(s), to charge your payment method for the Fees. If your payment cannot be completed, we will provide you written notice and may suspend access to the Services until payment is received. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are due upon invoice issuance. Payments are nonrefundable except as provided inÂ thisÂ Agreement.(b)Â Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Fees do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments (âTaxesâ). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, excluding Taxes based on our net income, and we may invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to timely pay such Taxes and provide us with documentation showing the payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably require. OpenAI uses the name and address in your account registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you must keep this information accurateÂ andÂ up-to-date.(c)Â Price Changes. We may change our prices by posting notice to your account and/or to our website. Price increases will be effective 14 days after they are posted, except for increases made for legal reasons or increases made to Beta Services (as defined in our Service Terms), which will be effective immediately.

If you want to dispute any Fees or Taxes, please contactÂ ar@openai.comÂ within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputed invoice. Undisputed amounts past due may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your access to the Services after we provide you written notice ofÂ lateÂ payment.(e)Â Free Tier. You may not create more than one account to benefit from credits provided in the free tier of the Services. If we believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may charge you standard fees or stop providing access toÂ theÂ Services.5. Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection(a)Â Confidentiality. You may be given access to Confidential Information of OpenAI, its affiliates and other third parties. You may use Confidential Information only as needed to use the Services as permitted under these Terms. You may not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, and you will protect Confidential Information in the same manner that you protect your own confidential information of a similar nature, using at least reasonable care. Confidential Information means nonpublic information that OpenAI or its affiliates or third parties designate as confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances, including software, specifications, and other nonpublic business information. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of yours; (ii) you already possess without any confidentiality obligations when you received it under these Terms; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you independently developed without using Confidential Information. You may disclose Confidential Information when required by law or the valid order of a court or other governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written notice to OpenAI and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of disclosure, including assisting us with challenging the disclosure requirement, in each caseÂ whereÂ possible.(b)Â Security. You must implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help secure your access to and use of the Services. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of the Services, you must promptly contact OpenAI and provide details of the vulnerabilityÂ orÂ breach.(c)Â Processing of Personal Data. If you use the Services to process personal data, you must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain necessary consents for the processing of such data, and you represent to us that you are processing such data in accordance with applicable law.

Term and Termination(a)Â Termination; Suspension. These Terms take effect when you first use the Services and remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason by discontinuing the use of the Services and Content. We may terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you at least 30 daysâ advance notice. We may terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution) or 9 (General Terms), if there are changes in relationships with third party technology providers outside of our control, or to comply with law orÂ governmentÂ requests. We may suspend your access to the Services if you do not comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent or could subject us or any third party to liability.(b)Â Effect on Termination. Upon termination, you will stop using the Services and you will promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any Confidential Information. The sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should survive, including but not limited to Sections 3Â andÂ 5-9.7. Indemnification; Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitations on Liability(a)Â Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneysâ fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your Content, products or services you develop or offer in connection with the Services, and your breach of these Terms or violation ofÂ applicableÂ law.(b)Â Disclaimer. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED âAS IS.â EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOSTÂ ORÂ ALTERED.(c)Â Limitations of Liability.Â NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED ââTHE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BYÂ APPLICABLEÂ LAW.8. Dispute ResolutionYOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERÂ PROVISIONS:(a)Â MANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and OpenAI agree to resolve any past or present claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by filling out this form within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevantÂ changes.(b)Â Informal Dispute Resolution.Â We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before filing a claim against OpenAI, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice atÂ dispute-resolution@openai.comÂ of your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days, you may bring a formal proceeding. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolutionÂ process. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.(c)Â Arbitration Forum. Either party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider. The parties will pay equal shares of the arbitration fees. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, OpenAI will pay them for you. OpenAI will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim isÂ frivolous.(d)Â Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, video conference, or in person in San Francisco, California or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR Services under its then-prevailing rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except a California court has the authority to determine (i) the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 8, including the mass filing procedures below, and (ii) whether you have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements in this section. The amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, ifÂ any.(e).Â Exceptions. This arbitration section does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual propertyÂ infringement.(f)Â NO CLASS ACTIONS.Â Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement ofÂ claims.(g)Â Mass Filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against OpenAI or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (âMass Filingâ), ADR Services will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the Mass Filings. Claims numbered 1-10 will be the âInitial Test Casesâ and will proceed to arbitration first. The arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference, unless the claims are resolved in advance or the parties agree to extend the deadline. The parties will then have 90 days (the âMediation Periodâ) to resolve the remaining cases in mediation based on the awards from the Initial Test Cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during this time, the parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court by providing written notice to the other party within 60 days after the Mediation Period. Otherwise, the remaining cases will be arbitrated in their assigned order. Any statute of limitations will be tolled from the time the Initial Test Cases are chosen until your case is chosen as described above.(h) Severability. If any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow Mass Filing or class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety. Nothing in this section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from theÂ arbitrator.9. General Terms(a)Â Relationship of the Parties. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between you and OpenAI or any of OpenAIâs affiliates. OpenAI and you are independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the otherâs behalf without the other partyâs priorÂ writtenÂ consent.(b)Â Use of Brands. You may not use OpenAIâs or any of its affiliatesâ names, logos, or trademarks, without our priorÂ writtenÂ consent.(c)Â U.S. Federal Agency Entities.Â The Services were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agencyÂ supplementsÂ thereto.(d)Â Copyright Complaints.Â If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please send notice to the address below or fill out this form.

Any purported assignment and delegation shall be null and void. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of aÂ corporateÂ reorganization.(f)Â Modifications.

These guidelines are intended to help our partners, resellers, customers, developers, consultants, publishers, and any other third parties understand how to use and display our trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.Powered by OpenAI badgeIf you are an active OpenAI API customer building using the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 series of our large language models, DALLÂ·E 2 or DALLÂ·E 3 image generation models, or any other OpenAI model or API, we encourage you to use our âPowered by OpenAIâ badge to signify that you use our APIs to build your product or features.Outlined badge on dark (preferred)Outlined badge on light (preferred)Filled badge on darkFilled badge on lightDownload badgesBest practices when using our badgeUse the outlined badge version whenever possible. The filled badge version should be used when placed over a background image and when legibility is a concern.Use enough space around the badgeâat least the size of the OpenAI logo that appears in the badge.Use at a minimum badge height of 32px.Donât modify the badge in any way.Donât translate the badge. In the future, we may provide translated versions for use directly.LanguageIf you are an active OpenAI API customer, please draw from the following language to accurately describe your company or productâs development on our APIs in any text. This language can be used for product UI, promotional and press materials, and App Store descriptions.Â Please use descriptive phrases that make it clear your product is developed on OpenAI technology (âpowered byâ is preferred, but âbuilt onâ can also be used). Avoid phrases that imply an official partnership with OpenAI (âbuilt withâ âdeveloped withâ âpartnered withâ).Your company or product name should appear first, followed by OpenAI or the model.Do:Meowlytics powered by OpenAIMeowlytics built on OpenAIMeowlytics developed on OpenAIDonât:Meowlytics with GPT-4Meowlytics AI by OpenAIChatGPT for MeowlyticsModelsIf you must refer to specific models,Â please use the proper model names or date-based versions of models when referring to OpenAI models.We do not permit the use of OpenAI models or âGPTâ in product or app names because it confuses end users.Do:Identify and refer to the appropriate model names: GPT-3, GPT-4, DALLÂ·E 3Refer to date-based versions of models if needed: GPT-4 Nov 6 versionUse âpowered by OpenAIâ when referring generally to OpenAI modelsDonât:Use OpenAI models in product or app names: GPT4Meow, MeowGPTUse model names incorrectly: Chat GPT, ChatGPT4, GPTChatDonât use the model classes: Ada, Babbage, Curie, Davinci, GPT-3.5-turboDonât use specific names: text-davinci-003Use âGPTâ generically without identifying the specific model: GPT-poweredPowered by OpenAI. A general, simplified way to describe products that are built on OpenAI models or multiple OpenAI models. Where possible, we recommend and prefer that you use the âPowered by OpenAIâ badge provided above. Please do not say âpowered by ChatGPTâ or âbuilt with ChatGPTâ to refer to products built with our APIs.Notifying users. If your product closely resembles an OpenAI product (such as ChatGPT), please make a clear indication to users that your product is independently developed and not affiliated, endorsed, or sponsored by OpenAI. Please consider your use of OpenAIâs product names, your own product copy, surrounding copy (e.g., app description), and any/all other attributes in this regard. It should be clear to your users that your application is separate and distinct from OpenAIâs own products and services.GPTs in ChatGPTGPTsâcustom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose with instructions, expanded knowledge, and custom actionsâare available to ChatGPT users.GPTs should have a short name appropriate for display in ChatGPTâs sidebar. Choose a name appropriate for an app or service, not the title of a document or video. Having a GPTâs name end with âGPTâ is discouraged, but not prohibited.If the GPT is part of an existing service and provides all or a subset of the same functionality, itâs recommended the GPT be named the same. For example if the service is called âMeowlyticsâ then the GPT should also be called âMeowlyticsâ. If instead the GPT is providing support for the service, then consider appending to the name, e.g., âMeowlytics API Helperâ.A GPT may not use another organizationâs trademark in its name or logo unless they are authorized to do so. Builders must verify their domain in order to use many common trademarks and OpenAI may reactively enforce this for others if reported. Additionally names referencing public figures, profanity, and harmful topics are prohibited. If a GPT makes use of third-party services, for example as part of its actions, these may be mentioned in the description.PluginsWhen referring to plugins for ChatGPT, please use the term âpluginâ rather than other names. Your company or product name should appear first, followed by OpenAI or ChatGPT. Please do not lead with the OpenAI name. (Please note that plugins are evolving into custom actions for GPTs.)Do:BarkBytes plugin for ChatGPTBarkBytes ChatGPT pluginDonât:BarkBytes plugin for OpenAIBarkBytes plugin compatible with ChatGPTBarkBytes plugin works with ChatGPTBarkBytes plugin integrated with ChatGPTNon-partnershipsOpenAI has official partnerships and specific language about these partnerships, as well as non-partnership language guidance. If you are not an official partner, please donât use âcollaborated with,â âworked with,â or âpartnered with,â in any form. Instead, we recommend you use the âPowered by OpenAIâ badge provided above.Do:Pawtopia is building on OpenAIThe Pawtopia product was developed on GPT-4Pawtopia is powered by OpenAIDonât:Pawtopia collaborated with OpenAIPawtopia worked with OpenAIPawtopia partnered with OpenAIPawtopia is building with OpenAIContent attributionIf publishing text or images generated by an OpenAI model, you are not required to attribute. However, if youâd like to, we encourage you to use the language below.Do:Written with ChatGPTCaption written with ChatGPTCreated with DALLÂ·EImage created with DALLÂ·E 3Donât:Written by ChatGPTCaption written by ChatGPTCreated by DALLÂ·EImage created by DALLÂ·EPress releasesWhen mentioning our company in your press materials, we ask that you identify OpenAI as an AI research and deployment company. OpenAIâsÂ missionÂ is to create safe and powerful AI that benefits all of humanity.If your announcement, blog, or other communications go beyond the cases outlined above, or if you have questions about our guidelines, we encourage you to reach out to OpenAIâs Partner Communications team atÂ partnercomms@openai.com.Usage termsThe term âMarksâ includes anything we use to identify our goods or services, including our names, logos, icons, and design elements. By using OpenAIâs Marks, you agree that we own them and that any goodwill generated by your use benefits us. Your permission to use our Marks is limited in the following ways:You can only use our Marks as allowed by these brand guidelines.The permission we grant is non-exclusive (we can give it to others) and non-transferrable (you cannot give it to others).You should not feature our Marks more prominently than your own companyâs name or marks.We may update the guide, and you must follow changes within a reasonable time.We can review your use of our Marks and require changes if needed.We may terminate your permission to use our Marks at any time, and you must stop using them promptly.Please ensure your app follows all OpenAI usage policies. If your project leverages our APIs or models (e.g. GPT-4 or DALLÂ·E 3), we prefer you use the âPowered by OpenAIâ badge provided above. You may choose to reference a specific model in your text description, though we typically prefer that you use the general âPowered by OpenAIâ wording instead.We do not permit model names in app titles because there is concern that it confuses end users and it also triggers our enforcement mechanisms. GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT, so itâs important that you do not reference just GPT in your app descriptions (we do not permit our GPT brand to be used in product names).LogosBy using our logos, you agree to our Marks usage terms.Download logosLogo spacing & sizing Use enough spacing around the logo. Use a logomark-to-container ratio of 116:180 in avatars. Orient the logomark with the central hexagon pointed top and bottom. Things to avoid when using our logoDonât use previous versions of our logo lockup.Donât create your own logo lockup.Donât pair the logomark with product or model names.Donât alter the logo in any way.We encourage you to select the black or white version which maximizes contrast, rather than custom colors.Donât use fill patterns.ContactFor legal inquiries, please contact legal@openai.com.For everything else, including requesting permission to use our logos, questions about these guidelines, or if your communications go beyond the cases outlined above, please contactÂ partnercomms@openai.com.ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "

Please adhere to theÂ following:Manually review each generation before sharing or whileÂ streaming.Attribute the content to your name or yourÂ company.Indicate that the content is AI-generated in a way no user could reasonably miss orÂ misunderstand.Do not share content that violates ourÂ Content PolicyÂ or that may offendÂ others.If taking audience requests for prompts, use good judgment; do not input prompts that might result in violations of ourÂ ContentÂ Policy.If you would like to ensure the OpenAI team is aware of a particular completion, you may email us or use the reporting tools withinÂ Playground.Recall that you are interacting with the raw model, which means we do not filter out biased or negative responses. (Also, you can read more about implementing our free Moderation endpointÂ here.)Content co-authored with the OpenAI APICreators who wish to publish their first-party written content (e.g., a book, compendium of short stories) created in part with the OpenAI API are permitted to do so under the followingÂ conditions:The published content is attributed to your name orÂ company.The role of AI in formulating the content is clearly disclosed in a way that no reader could possibly miss, and that a typical reader would find sufficiently easy toÂ understand.Topics of the content do not violate OpenAIâsÂ Content PolicyÂ orÂ Terms of Use, e.g., are not related to adult content, spam, hateful content, content that incites violence, or other uses that may cause socialÂ harm.We kindly ask that you refrain from sharing outputs that may offendÂ others.For instance, one must detail in a Foreword or Introduction (or some place similar) the relative roles of drafting, editing, etc. People should not represent API-generated content as being wholly generated by a human or wholly generated by an AI, and it is a human who must take ultimate responsibility for the content beingÂ published.Here is some stock language you may use to describe your creative process, provided it isÂ accurate:The author generated this text in part with GPT-3, OpenAIâs large-scale language-generation model. Upon generating draft language, the author reviewed, edited, and revised the language to their own liking and takes ultimate responsibility for the content of thisÂ publication.ResearchWe believe it is important for the broader world to be able to evaluate our research and products, especially to understand and improve potential weaknesses and safety or bias problems in our models. Accordingly, we welcome research publications related to the OpenAIÂ API.If you have any questions about research publications based on API access or would like to give us advanced notice of a publication (though not required), please email us atÂ papers@openai.com.In some cases, we may want to highlight your work internally and/orÂ externally.In others, such as publications that pertain to security or misuse of the API, we may want to take appropriate actions to protect ourÂ users.If you notice any safety or security issues with the API in the course of your research, we ask that you please submit these immediately through ourÂ Coordinated Vulnerability DisclosureÂ Program.Researcher Access ProgramThere are a number of research directions we are excited to explore with the OpenAI API. If you are interested in the opportunity for subsidized access, please provide us with details about your research use case on theÂ Researcher Access Program application.In particular, we consider the following to be especially important directions, though you are free to craft your ownÂ direction:Alignment: How can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design orÂ fine-tuning?Fairness and representation: How should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployedÂ contexts?Interdisciplinary research: How can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, andÂ sociolinguistics?Interpretability and transparency: How do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts theyâre using, or extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising futureÂ behavior?Misuse potential: How can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of âred teamingâ approaches can we develop to help us and other AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies likeÂ this?Model exploration: Models like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which we have yet to explore. Weâre excited by investigations in many areas including model limitations, linguistic properties, commonsense reasoning, and potential uses for many otherÂ problems.Robustness: Generative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong and surprisingly weak areas of capability. How robust are large generative models to ânaturalâ perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with or without typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust (or not robust), and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g., across variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarialÂ inputs?Please note that due to a high volume of requests, it takes time for us to review these applications and not all research will be prioritized for subsidy. We will only be in touch if your application is selected forÂ subsidy.ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "

Proficient in more than a dozen programming languages, Codex can now interpret simple commands in natural language and execute them on the userâs behalfâmaking it possible to build a natural language interface to existing applications. We are now inviting businesses and developers to build on top of OpenAI Codex through ourÂ API.Play videoPlay videoPlay videoPlay videoPlay videoPlay videoVideo carousel navigationGo to slide 1Go to slide 2Go to slide 3Go to slide 4Go to slide 5Go to slide 6Creating a Space Game with OpenAI CodexTweetOpenAI Codex is a descendant of GPT-3; its training data contains both natural language and billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources, including code in public GitHub repositories. OpenAI Codex is most capable in Python, but it is also proficient in over a dozen languages including JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift and TypeScript, and even Shell. It has a memory of 14KB for Python code, compared to GPT-3 which has only 4KBâso it can take into account over 3x as much contextual information while performing anyÂ task.GPT-3âs main skill is generating natural language in response to a natural language prompt, meaning the only way it affects the world is through the mind of the reader. OpenAI Codex has much of the natural language understanding of GPT-3, but it produces working codeâmeaning you can issue commands in English to any piece of software with an API. OpenAI Codex empowers computers to better understand peopleâs intent, which can empower everyone to do more withÂ computers.Once a programmer knows what to build, the act of writing code can be thought of as (1) breaking a problem down into simpler problems, and (2) mapping those simple problems to existing code (libraries, APIs, or functions) that already exist. The latter activity is probably the least fun part of programming (and the highest barrier to entry), and itâs where OpenAI Codex excelsÂ most.OpenAI Codex is a general-purpose programming model, meaning that it can be applied to essentially any programming task (though results may vary). Weâve successfully used it for transpilation, explaining code, and refactoring code. But we know weâve only scratched the surface of what can beÂ done.Weâre now making OpenAI Codex available in private beta via our API, and we are aiming to scale up as quickly as we can safely. During the initial period, OpenAI Codex will be offered for free. OpenAI will continue building on the safety groundwork we laid with GPT-3âreviewing applications and incrementally scaling them up while working closely with developers to understand the effect of our technologies in theÂ world.Start using CodexAuthorsWojciech ZarembaView all articlesGreg BrockmanView all articlesOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "

IntroductionPlugins and Actions (together âPluginsâ) allow OpenAI services (âServicesâ) such as ChatGPT to retrieve information from or send instructions to an API (âAPIâ) created according to our AI Plugin Protocol. Users of OpenAI Services can choose to enable Plugins within certain Services. For example, a ChatGPT user who wants to make a restaurant reservation could enable a restaurant reservation Plugin and instruct ChatGPT to make the reservation.These Plugin Terms (âTermsâ) govern the creation and use of your Plugin in connection with OpenAI Services. These Terms include ourÂ Usage Policies and other documentation, guidelines, or policies we may provide in writing or on our website. By creating an API or by explicitly agreeing to these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you create a Plugin on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on their behalf.2. Plugins(a) Access. We may: (i) access and use your API to enable your Plugin within the Services; and (ii) allow our users to access and use your Plugin to retrieve information or take action on your website or application through the Services. We will not: (i) use your API to modify, translate, or create derivative works of your API; (ii) lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer rights to your API to any third party; or (iii) intentionally interfere with or disrupt your API or any of its security measures.(b) Plugin Requests. The Services will send a request to your API containing information on behalf of a user of the Services (âPlugin Requestâ). If you have entered into a separate agreement with a user to process their information contained in a Plugin Request, then the terms of that separate agreement apply. Otherwise, you may only collect, use, store, transmit, and process Plugin Requests (i) in accordance with all applicable laws; and (ii) only as necessary to respond to or follow the instructions of the Plugin Request or to comply with applicable law. We are not responsible for any content or information from users or other Plugins that is sent to your API.(c) Plugin Responses. When your API receives a Plugin Request, it will send information or content back to the Services (âPlugin Responseâ). You are responsible for ensuring your Plugin Responses and API comply with all applicable laws and our Usage Policies. You grant us a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, copy, translate, display, modify, and distribute all or any part of the Plugin Response to enable your Plugin to function within the Services. Upon termination of these Terms or if you remove your Plugin from the Services, we may continue to use Plugin Responses to maintain usersâ Service history. You represent and warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all necessary rights (including from your users) to grant us these rights and to operate your Plugin. Except for the license rights granted in these Terms, you retain all rights in your API and Plugin Responses.(d) Plugin Reviews. While we are not obligated to monitor Plugins or their content, we may at any time: (i) review or test your Plugin to ensure quality and compliance with these Terms; or (ii) remove or refuse to display any content that violates these Terms. We may refuse to include any Plugin in our Services and may remove any Plugin from our Services at any time for any reason. Any information you give to us will be accurate and up-to-date.(e) Restrictions. Your API and Plugin Responses will not: (i) pose a security vulnerability or threat to our users, us, or any third party; (ii) interact with our users in a manner that is deceptive, false, misleading, or harassing; (iii) return or contain illegal, defamatory, pornographic, harmful, infringing, or otherwise objectionable content; (iv) include any malware, viruses, surveillance, or other malicious programs or code; (v) interfere with, damage, or access in any unauthorized manner any software, technology or services of ours or any third party; (vi) use Plugin Requests to develop models that compete with OpenAI; or (vii) send us any personal information of children under 13 or the applicable age of digital consent.(f) Feedback. If you provide feedback or suggestions on our AI Plugin Protocol, Plugins or Services, we may freely use that feedback without any obligation to you.3. Security; Privacy(a) API Security Measures. You are responsible for the privacy, security, and integrity of your API and any Plugin Requests that you receive. You will maintain at least reasonable and appropriate organizational, administrative, physical, and technical security measures to keep your API and Plugin Requests secure. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your API or a Plugin Request, you must promptly contact us and provide details of the vulnerabilityÂ orÂ breach.(b) OpenAI Security Measures. We will maintain reasonable and appropriate organizational, administrative, physical, and technical security measures designed to keep the Services secure, including protecting any developer credentials such as access tokens or client secrets that you give us. You may set and enforce limitations on our use of your API, such as rate limiting. We will not intentionally attempt to circumvent those limitations.(c) Privacy. To the extent Plugin Requests contain personal data, you will only process that data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. If users are required to authenticate to your website or application, then you may only use their information: (i) as authorized by the user and (ii) in accordance with a legally adequate privacy notice. We will both act as separate and independent data controllers of personal data.4. Trademarks(a) OpenAI Trademarks. Subject to our branding guidelines, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as provided in Section 7(d)) license to use our name, logo, and other trademarks (âOpenAI Trademarksâ) solely to promote your Plugin. You may not imply that we created, support, or endorse your Plugin without our prior written consent. All goodwill derived from your use of OpenAI Trademarks will inure to our sole benefit. You may not otherwise use OpenAI Trademarks without prior written consent.(b) Plugin Trademarks. Subject to any branding guidelines you provide us, you grant us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as provided in Section 7(d)) license to use your name, logo, and other trademarks (âPlugin Trademarksâ) solely to display your Plugin within our Services and to promote our Plugin feature. We may not imply that you support or endorse our Services without your prior written consent. All goodwill derived from our use of Plugin Trademarks will inure to your sole benefit. We will not otherwise use Plugin Trademarks without prior written consent.5. Termination(a) Termination. These Terms take effect when you first create your Plugin and remain in effect until terminated. You or we can terminate these Terms by removing your Plugin from the Services for any reason by providing at least 30 daysâ advance notice to the other party, except you can terminate the Terms immediately with notice to us if you determine that our use of your Plugin exposes you, your users, or others to risk of liability or harm. We may suspend or terminate these Terms immediately if you materially breach these terms, we determine that your Plugin exposes us or anyone else to risk of liability or harm, or to comply with law or government requests.(b) Survival. The sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should survive, including but not limited to 2(b), 2(c) and 2(f) and 5-7.6. Indemnification; Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability(a)Â Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any third-party claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneysâ fees) arising from or relating to your Plugin, including Plugin Responses, your website or application that is connected to the Plugin, and your violation of these Terms or applicableÂ law.(b)Â Disclaimer. OUR PLUGIN FEATURE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED âAS IS.â EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE PLUGIN FEATURE AND SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE.

Subject to our brand guidelines, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the name âGPTâÂ to create your own GPT. You may not imply that we create, support, or endorse your GPT without our prior written consent.Â For Users of GPTs:(a) Third Party GPTs. Except where OpenAI is identified as the builder of a GPT, GPTs are created by other users and they may rely on content or third party applications that are not controlled by OpenAI. Only use GPTs that you know and trust.(b) Abuse Reporting. You can report GPTs that violate our Usage Policies using our reporting feature within ChatGPT.(c) Custom Actions. GPTs may allow you to interact with Actions. Those Actions are subject to our terms for Plugins and Actions below.(d) Changes and Removal. OpenAI and creators of GPTs can remove GPTs at any time without prior notice.6. Image CapabilitiesOur models can accept images as part of Inputs to the Service (âImage Capabilitiesâ).(a) Not for Medical Advice. Image Capabilities are not designed or intended to be used as a medical device or to perform any medical function and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, or judgment.Â (b) Images with People. You may not use Image Capabilities to assist in identifying a person or to solicit or infer private or sensitive information about a person.7. Plugins and Actions(a) Overview. Plugins and Actions (together âPluginsâ) are features in ChatGPT that allow you to send instructions to and receive information from another application or website (âApplicationâ) while using our Services. Each Plugin is made available by the developer of the Application, which is typically a third party not affiliated with OpenAI. You may take action on an Application through one or more Plugins. For example, you may enable a plugin for a restaurant reservation website to request a reservation via the Services. You are solely responsible for the actions you take using Plugins. You must manually enable each plugin, which allows the applicable Service to access and use the enabled plugin. OpenAI may (but will have no obligation) to review, refuse, or remove Applications from ChatGPT. However, by using Plugins, you may be exposed to Applications or content that you may find offensive, inappropriate or objectionable. You agree that you use Plugins at your own risk. DO NOT ENABLE A PLUGIN UNLESS YOU KNOW AND TRUST THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION AND HAVE REVIEWED ITS TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY.(b) Plugin Operation and Content. When you enable a plugin, the Services will send applicable portions of your Content and certain information such as your country and state (âPlugin Dataâ) via the plugin to the Application. By enabling the plugin, you authorize and instruct us to send your Plugin Data to the applicable Application, which will be handled in accordance with its terms. We are not responsible for Plugin Data after it has been provided to an Application other than Applications owned by us. The Plugin will retrieve information and content from the Application, which may be included in Output you receive from the Services. This information and content included in the Output is not owned by you or OpenAI, and may be subject to the terms of the Application.8. Voice ConversationsVoice conversations is a ChatGPT feature that allows you to speak to our models and have them speak back (âChatGPT Voice Outputâ). ChatGPT Voice Output is for non-commercial use only and may not be distributed or repackaged as a standalone audio recording or any other sound file. Any rights in Output assigned to you do not include ChatGPT Voice Output.ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "

Please adhere to theÂ following:Manually review each generation before sharing or whileÂ streaming.Attribute the content to your name or yourÂ company.Indicate that the content is AI-generated in a way no user could reasonably miss orÂ misunderstand.Do not share content that violates ourÂ Content PolicyÂ or that may offendÂ others.If taking audience requests for prompts, use good judgment; do not input prompts that might result in violations of ourÂ ContentÂ Policy.If you would like to ensure the OpenAI team is aware of a particular completion, you may email us or use the reporting tools withinÂ Playground.Recall that you are interacting with the raw model, which means we do not filter out biased or negative responses. (Also, you can read more about implementing our free Moderation endpointÂ here.)Content co-authored with the OpenAI APICreators who wish to publish their first-party written content (e.g., a book, compendium of short stories) created in part with the OpenAI API are permitted to do so under the followingÂ conditions:The published content is attributed to your name orÂ company.The role of AI in formulating the content is clearly disclosed in a way that no reader could possibly miss, and that a typical reader would find sufficiently easy toÂ understand.Topics of the content do not violate OpenAIâsÂ Content PolicyÂ orÂ Terms of Use, e.g., are not related to adult content, spam, hateful content, content that incites violence, or other uses that may cause socialÂ harm.We kindly ask that you refrain from sharing outputs that may offendÂ others.For instance, one must detail in a Foreword or Introduction (or some place similar) the relative roles of drafting, editing, etc. People should not represent API-generated content as being wholly generated by a human or wholly generated by an AI, and it is a human who must take ultimate responsibility for the content beingÂ published.Here is some stock language you may use to describe your creative process, provided it isÂ accurate:The author generated this text in part with GPT-3, OpenAIâs large-scale language-generation model. Upon generating draft language, the author reviewed, edited, and revised the language to their own liking and takes ultimate responsibility for the content of thisÂ publication.ResearchWe believe it is important for the broader world to be able to evaluate our research and products, especially to understand and improve potential weaknesses and safety or bias problems in our models. Accordingly, we welcome research publications related to the OpenAIÂ API.If you have any questions about research publications based on API access or would like to give us advanced notice of a publication (though not required), please email us atÂ papers@openai.com.In some cases, we may want to highlight your work internally and/orÂ externally.In others, such as publications that pertain to security or misuse of the API, we may want to take appropriate actions to protect ourÂ users.If you notice any safety or security issues with the API in the course of your research, we ask that you please submit these immediately through ourÂ Coordinated Vulnerability DisclosureÂ Program.Researcher Access ProgramThere are a number of research directions we are excited to explore with the OpenAI API. If you are interested in the opportunity for subsidized access, please provide us with details about your research use case on theÂ Researcher Access Program application.In particular, we consider the following to be especially important directions, though you are free to craft your ownÂ direction:Alignment: How can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design orÂ fine-tuning?Fairness and representation: How should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployedÂ contexts?Interdisciplinary research: How can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, andÂ sociolinguistics?Interpretability and transparency: How do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts theyâre using, or extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising futureÂ behavior?Misuse potential: How can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of âred teamingâ approaches can we develop to help us and other AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies likeÂ this?Model exploration: Models like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which we have yet to explore. Weâre excited by investigations in many areas including model limitations, linguistic properties, commonsense reasoning, and potential uses for many otherÂ problems.Robustness: Generative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong and surprisingly weak areas of capability. How robust are large generative models to ânaturalâ perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with or without typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust (or not robust), and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g., across variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarialÂ inputs?Please note that due to a high volume of requests, it takes time for us to review these applications and not all research will be prioritized for subsidy. We will only be in touch if your application is selected forÂ subsidy.ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "

The Terms include ourÂ Service Terms,Â Sharing & Publication Policy,Â Usage Policies, and other documentation, guidelines, or policies we may provide in writing. By using our Services, you agree to theseÂ Terms. OurÂ Privacy PolicyÂ explains how we collect and use personalÂ information.1. Registration and AccessYou must be at least 13 years old to use the Services. If you are under 18 you must have your parent or legal guardianâs permission to use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of another person or entity, you must have the authority to accept the Terms on their behalf. You must provide accurate and complete information to register for an account. You may not make your access credentials or account available to others outside your organization, and you are responsible for all activities that occur usingÂ yourÂ credentials.2. Usage Requirements(a)Â Use of Services. You may access, and we grant you a non-exclusive right to use, the Services in accordance with these Terms. You will comply with these Terms and all applicable laws when using the Services. We and our affiliates own all rights, title, and interest in and toÂ theÂ Services.(b)Â Feedback. We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements. If you provide any of these things, we may use it without restriction or compensationÂ toÂ you.(c)Â Restrictions. You may not (i) use the Services in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates any personâs rights; (ii) reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, translate or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying components of models, algorithms, and systems of the Services (except to the extent such restrictions are contrary to applicable law); (iii) use output from the Services to develop models that compete with OpenAI; (iv) except as permitted through the API, use any automated or programmatic method to extract data or output from the Services, including scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction; (v) represent that output from the Services was human-generated when it is not or otherwise violate our Usage Policies; (vi) buy, sell, or transfer API keys without our prior consent; or (vii), send us any personal information of children under 13 or the applicable age of digital consent. You will comply with any rate limits and other requirements in our documentation. You may use Services only in geographiesÂ currently supportedÂ byÂ OpenAI.(d)Â Third Party Services. Any third party software, services, or other products you use in connection with the Services are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for thirdÂ partyÂ products.3. Content(a)Â Your Content. You may provide input to the Services (âInputâ), and receive output generated and returned by the Services based on the Input (âOutputâ). Input and Output are collectively âContent.â As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, OpenAI hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output. This means you can use Content for any purpose, including commercial purposes such as sale or publication, if you comply with these Terms. OpenAI may use Content to provide and maintain the Services, comply with applicable law, and enforce our policies. You are responsible for Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law orÂ theseÂ Terms.(b)Â Similarity of Content. Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for OpenAI or a third party. For example, you may provide input to a model such as âWhat color is the sky?â and receive output such as âThe sky is blue.â Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same response. Responses that are requested by and generated for other users are not consideredÂ yourÂ Content.(c)Â Use of Content to Improve Services. We do not use Content that you provide to or receive from our API (âAPI Contentâ) to develop or improve our Services. We may use Content from Services other than our API (âNon-API Contentâ) to help develop and improve our Services. You can read more here aboutÂ how Non-API Content may be used to improve model performance. If you do not want your Non-API Content used to improve Services, you can opt out by filling outÂ this form. Please note that in some cases this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your specificÂ useÂ case.(d) Accuracy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.4. Fees and Payments(a)Â Fees and Billing. You will pay all fees charged to your account (âFeesâ) according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise agreed between us in writing. We have the right to correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received payment. You will provide complete and accurate billing information including a valid and authorized payment method. We will charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic basis, but may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You authorize OpenAI and its affiliates, and our third-party payment processor(s), to charge your payment method for the Fees. If your payment cannot be completed, we will provide you written notice and may suspend access to the Services until payment is received. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are due upon invoice issuance. Payments are nonrefundable except as provided inÂ thisÂ Agreement.(b)Â Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Fees do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments (âTaxesâ). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, excluding Taxes based on our net income, and we may invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to timely pay such Taxes and provide us with documentation showing the payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably require. OpenAI uses the name and address in your account registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you must keep this information accurateÂ andÂ up-to-date.(c)Â Price Changes. We may change our prices by posting notice to your account and/or to our website. Price increases will be effective 14 days after they are posted, except for increases made for legal reasons or increases made to Beta Services (as defined in our Service Terms), which will be effective immediately. Any price changes will apply to the Fees charged to your account immediately after the effective date ofÂ theÂ changes.(d)Â Disputes and Late Payments. If you want to dispute any Fees or Taxes, please contactÂ ar@openai.comÂ within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputed invoice. Undisputed amounts past due may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your access to the Services after we provide you written notice ofÂ lateÂ payment.(e)Â Free Tier. You may not create more than one account to benefit from credits provided in the free tier of the Services. If we believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may charge you standard fees or stop providing access toÂ theÂ Services.5. Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection(a)Â Confidentiality. You may be given access to Confidential Information of OpenAI, its affiliates and other third parties. You may use Confidential Information only as needed to use the Services as permitted under these Terms. You may not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, and you will protect Confidential Information in the same manner that you protect your own confidential information of a similar nature, using at least reasonable care. Confidential Information means nonpublic information that OpenAI or its affiliates or third parties designate as confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances, including software, specifications, and other nonpublic business information. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of yours; (ii) you already possess without any confidentiality obligations when you received it under these Terms; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you independently developed without using Confidential Information. You may disclose Confidential Information when required by law or the valid order of a court or other governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written notice to OpenAI and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of disclosure, including assisting us with challenging the disclosure requirement, in each caseÂ whereÂ possible.(b)Â Security. You must implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help secure your access to and use of the Services. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of the Services, you must promptly contact OpenAI and provide details of the vulnerabilityÂ orÂ breach.(c)Â Processing of Personal Data. If you use the Services to process personal data, you must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain necessary consents for the processing of such data, and you represent to us that you are processing such data in accordance with applicable law. If you will be using the OpenAI API for the processing of âpersonal dataâ as defined in the GDPR or âPersonal Informationâ as defined in CCPA, please fill out this form to request to execute our Data Processing Addendum.6. Term and Termination(a)Â Termination; Suspension. These Terms take effect when you first use the Services and remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason by discontinuing the use of the Services and Content. We may terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you at least 30 daysâ advance notice. We may terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution) or 9 (General Terms), if there are changes in relationships with third party technology providers outside of our control, or to comply with law orÂ governmentÂ requests. We may suspend your access to the Services if you do not comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent or could subject us or any third party to liability.(b)Â Effect on Termination. Upon termination, you will stop using the Services and you will promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any Confidential Information. The sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should survive, including but not limited to Sections 3Â andÂ 5-9.7. Indemnification; Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitations on Liability(a)Â Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneysâ fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your Content, products or services you develop or offer in connection with the Services, and your breach of these Terms or violation ofÂ applicableÂ law.(b)Â Disclaimer. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED âAS IS.â EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOSTÂ ORÂ ALTERED.(c)Â Limitations of Liability.Â NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED ââTHE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BYÂ APPLICABLEÂ LAW.8. Dispute ResolutionYOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERÂ PROVISIONS:(a)Â MANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and OpenAI agree to resolve any past or present claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by filling out this form within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevantÂ changes.(b)Â Informal Dispute Resolution.Â We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before filing a claim against OpenAI, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice atÂ dispute-resolution@openai.comÂ of your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days, you may bring a formal proceeding. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolutionÂ process. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.(c)Â Arbitration Forum. Either party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider. The parties will pay equal shares of the arbitration fees. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, OpenAI will pay them for you. OpenAI will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim isÂ frivolous.(d)Â Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, video conference, or in person in San Francisco, California or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR Services under its then-prevailing rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except a California court has the authority to determine (i) the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 8, including the mass filing procedures below, and (ii) whether you have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements in this section. The amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, ifÂ any.(e).Â Exceptions. This arbitration section does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual propertyÂ infringement.(f)Â NO CLASS ACTIONS.Â Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement ofÂ claims.(g)Â Mass Filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against OpenAI or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (âMass Filingâ), ADR Services will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the Mass Filings. Claims numbered 1-10 will be the âInitial Test Casesâ and will proceed to arbitration first. The arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference, unless the claims are resolved in advance or the parties agree to extend the deadline. The parties will then have 90 days (the âMediation Periodâ) to resolve the remaining cases in mediation based on the awards from the Initial Test Cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during this time, the parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court by providing written notice to the other party within 60 days after the Mediation Period. Otherwise, the remaining cases will be arbitrated in their assigned order. Any statute of limitations will be tolled from the time the Initial Test Cases are chosen until your case is chosen as described above.(h) Severability. If any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow Mass Filing or class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety. Nothing in this section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from theÂ arbitrator.9. General Terms(a)Â Relationship of the Parties. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between you and OpenAI or any of OpenAIâs affiliates. OpenAI and you are independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the otherâs behalf without the other partyâs priorÂ writtenÂ consent.(b)Â Use of Brands. You may not use OpenAIâs or any of its affiliatesâ names, logos, or trademarks, without our priorÂ writtenÂ consent.(c)Â U.S. Federal Agency Entities.Â The Services were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agencyÂ supplementsÂ thereto.(d)Â Copyright Complaints.Â If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please send notice to the address below or fill out this form.

Any purported assignment and delegation shall be null and void. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of aÂ corporateÂ reorganization.(f)Â Modifications. We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on the website, or if an update materially adversely affects your rights or obligations under these Terms we will provide notice to you either by emailing the email associated with your account or providing an in-product notification. Those changes will become effective no sooner than 30 days after we notify you. All other changes will be effective immediately.

Except as provided in Section 8, if any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of anyÂ otherÂ terms.(i)Â Export Controls. The Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, exported, or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries (collectively, the âEmbargoed Countriesâ) or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Departmentâs list of Specially Designated Nationals, any other restricted party lists (existing now or in the future) identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List, or any other restricted party lists (collectively, âRestricted Party Listsâ).

You must comply with all applicable laws related to Embargoed Countries or Restricted Party Lists, including any requirements or obligations to know your endÂ usersÂ directly.(j)Â Equitable Remedies.Â You acknowledge that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may cause irreparable harm to OpenAI and its affiliates, and OpenAI shall have the right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition to any otherÂ legalÂ remedies.(k)Â Entire Agreement.Â These Terms and any policies incorporated in these Terms contain the entire agreement between you and OpenAI regarding the use of the Services and, other than any Service specific terms of use or any applicable enterprise agreements, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings between you and OpenAI onÂ thatÂ subject.(l)Â Jurisdiction, Venue and Choice of Law.

IntroductionPlugins and Actions (together âPluginsâ) allow OpenAI services (âServicesâ) such as ChatGPT to retrieve information from or send instructions to an API (âAPIâ) created according to our AI Plugin Protocol. Users of OpenAI Services can choose to enable Plugins within certain Services. For example, a ChatGPT user who wants to make a restaurant reservation could enable a restaurant reservation Plugin and instruct ChatGPT to make the reservation.These Plugin Terms (âTermsâ) govern the creation and use of your Plugin in connection with OpenAI Services. These Terms include ourÂ Usage Policies and other documentation, guidelines, or policies we may provide in writing or on our website. By creating an API or by explicitly agreeing to these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you create a Plugin on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on their behalf.2. Plugins(a) Access. We may: (i) access and use your API to enable your Plugin within the Services; and (ii) allow our users to access and use your Plugin to retrieve information or take action on your website or application through the Services. We will not: (i) use your API to modify, translate, or create derivative works of your API; (ii) lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer rights to your API to any third party; or (iii) intentionally interfere with or disrupt your API or any of its security measures.(b) Plugin Requests. The Services will send a request to your API containing information on behalf of a user of the Services (âPlugin Requestâ). If you have entered into a separate agreement with a user to process their information contained in a Plugin Request, then the terms of that separate agreement apply. Otherwise, you may only collect, use, store, transmit, and process Plugin Requests (i) in accordance with all applicable laws; and (ii) only as necessary to respond to or follow the instructions of the Plugin Request or to comply with applicable law. We are not responsible for any content or information from users or other Plugins that is sent to your API.(c) Plugin Responses. When your API receives a Plugin Request, it will send information or content back to the Services (âPlugin Responseâ). You are responsible for ensuring your Plugin Responses and API comply with all applicable laws and our Usage Policies. You grant us a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, copy, translate, display, modify, and distribute all or any part of the Plugin Response to enable your Plugin to function within the Services. Upon termination of these Terms or if you remove your Plugin from the Services, we may continue to use Plugin Responses to maintain usersâ Service history. You represent and warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all necessary rights (including from your users) to grant us these rights and to operate your Plugin. Except for the license rights granted in these Terms, you retain all rights in your API and Plugin Responses.(d) Plugin Reviews. While we are not obligated to monitor Plugins or their content, we may at any time: (i) review or test your Plugin to ensure quality and compliance with these Terms; or (ii) remove or refuse to display any content that violates these Terms. We may refuse to include any Plugin in our Services and may remove any Plugin from our Services at any time for any reason. Any information you give to us will be accurate and up-to-date.(e) Restrictions. Your API and Plugin Responses will not: (i) pose a security vulnerability or threat to our users, us, or any third party; (ii) interact with our users in a manner that is deceptive, false, misleading, or harassing; (iii) return or contain illegal, defamatory, pornographic, harmful, infringing, or otherwise objectionable content; (iv) include any malware, viruses, surveillance, or other malicious programs or code; (v) interfere with, damage, or access in any unauthorized manner any software, technology or services of ours or any third party; (vi) use Plugin Requests to develop models that compete with OpenAI; or (vii) send us any personal information of children under 13 or the applicable age of digital consent.(f) Feedback. If you provide feedback or suggestions on our AI Plugin Protocol, Plugins or Services, we may freely use that feedback without any obligation to you.3. Security; Privacy(a) API Security Measures. You are responsible for the privacy, security, and integrity of your API and any Plugin Requests that you receive. You will maintain at least reasonable and appropriate organizational, administrative, physical, and technical security measures to keep your API and Plugin Requests secure. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your API or a Plugin Request, you must promptly contact us and provide details of the vulnerabilityÂ orÂ breach.(b) OpenAI Security Measures. We will maintain reasonable and appropriate organizational, administrative, physical, and technical security measures designed to keep the Services secure, including protecting any developer credentials such as access tokens or client secrets that you give us. You may set and enforce limitations on our use of your API, such as rate limiting. We will not intentionally attempt to circumvent those limitations.(c) Privacy. To the extent Plugin Requests contain personal data, you will only process that data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. If users are required to authenticate to your website or application, then you may only use their information: (i) as authorized by the user and (ii) in accordance with a legally adequate privacy notice. We will both act as separate and independent data controllers of personal data.4. Trademarks(a) OpenAI Trademarks. Subject to our branding guidelines, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as provided in Section 7(d)) license to use our name, logo, and other trademarks (âOpenAI Trademarksâ) solely to promote your Plugin. You may not imply that we created, support, or endorse your Plugin without our prior written consent. All goodwill derived from your use of OpenAI Trademarks will inure to our sole benefit. You may not otherwise use OpenAI Trademarks without prior written consent.(b) Plugin Trademarks. Subject to any branding guidelines you provide us, you grant us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as provided in Section 7(d)) license to use your name, logo, and other trademarks (âPlugin Trademarksâ) solely to display your Plugin within our Services and to promote our Plugin feature. We may not imply that you support or endorse our Services without your prior written consent. All goodwill derived from our use of Plugin Trademarks will inure to your sole benefit. We will not otherwise use Plugin Trademarks without prior written consent.5. Termination(a) Termination. These Terms take effect when you first create your Plugin and remain in effect until terminated. You or we can terminate these Terms by removing your Plugin from the Services for any reason by providing at least 30 daysâ advance notice to the other party, except you can terminate the Terms immediately with notice to us if you determine that our use of your Plugin exposes you, your users, or others to risk of liability or harm. We may suspend or terminate these Terms immediately if you materially breach these terms, we determine that your Plugin exposes us or anyone else to risk of liability or harm, or to comply with law or government requests.(b) Survival. The sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should survive, including but not limited to 2(b), 2(c) and 2(f) and 5-7.6. Indemnification; Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability(a)Â Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any third-party claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneysâ fees) arising from or relating to your Plugin, including Plugin Responses, your website or application that is connected to the Plugin, and your violation of these Terms or applicableÂ law.(b)Â Disclaimer.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE PLUGIN FEATURE AND SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOSTÂ ORÂ ALTERED.(c)Â Limitations of Liability.Â NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED ââTHE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BYÂ APPLICABLEÂ LAW.7. General Terms(a)Â Modifications. We may update these Terms from time to time. We will give you notice of the changes by posting an updated version of these Terms online or by emailing you at an email address you have provided.

You and OpenAI agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed (a âDisputeâ), through final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation or of any updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by filling out this form. If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed upon arbitration terms will apply.Â Informal Dispute Resolution. We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending us notice through this form. We will do so by sending you notice to the email address associated with your account. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this informal resolution process.Arbitration Forum. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of us may commence arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (âNAMâ) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available here). OpenAI will not seek attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The activities described in these Terms involve interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and any arbitration.Â Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference if possible, but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person, the location will be mutually agreed upon, in the county where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California have the authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief, as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.Â Exceptions. This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.CLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. You and OpenAI agree that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate in court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You and OpenAI knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.Â Batch Arbitration. If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then you and OpenAI agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (âBatchâ), unless there are less than 50 claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings.Â Â Severability. If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.Copyright ComplaintsIf you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please send notice to the address below or fill out this form. We may delete or disable content that we believe violates these Terms or is alleged to be infringing and will terminate accounts of repeat infringers where appropriate.OpenAI, L.L.C.3180 18th St.San Francisco, California 94110Attn: General Counsel / Copyright AgentWritten claims concerning copyright infringement must include the following information:A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interestA description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed uponA description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on our site so we can find itYour address, telephone number, and e-mail addressA statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the lawA statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright ownerâs behalfGeneral TermsAssignment.

All other changes will be effective as soon as we post them to our website. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using our Services.Delay in Enforcing These Terms. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later. Except as provided in the dispute resolution section above, if any portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any other terms.Trade Controls. You must comply with all applicable trade laws, including sanctions and export control laws. Our Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, or exported or re-exported to (a) any U.S. embargoed country or territory or (b) any individual or entity with whom dealings are prohibited or restricted under applicable trade laws.

If you are interested in an opportunity for subsidized access, please apply for API credits.Note that this will take you to a third-party provider, SurveyMonkey Apply, where youâll need to create an account to apply.We encourage applications from early stage researchers in countries supported by our API, and are especially interested in subsidizing work from researchers with limited financial and institutional resources. Please note that the expected turnaround time for accepted applicants would be around 4â6 weeks.Before applying, please take a moment to review our Research Policy.Areas of interest includeAlignmentHow can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design or fine-tuning?Fairness & representationHow should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?Societal ImpactHow do we create measurements for AIâs impact on society? What impact does AI have on different domains and groups of people?Â Interdisciplinary researchHow can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and sociolinguistics?Interpretability/transparencyHow do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts theyâre using, extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising future behavior?Misuse potentialHow can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of âred teamingâ approaches can we develop to help AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like this?RobustnessHow robust are large generative models to ânaturalâ perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust or not, and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g., across variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarial inputs?OtherWeâre initially scoping to these areas, but welcome suggestions for future focus areas. The questions under each area are illustrative and weâd be delighted for research proposals that address different questions.Apply for API creditsResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewData privacyPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewEnterpriseTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top "
